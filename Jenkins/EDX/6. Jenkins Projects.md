# Jenkins Projects

# Chapter Overview

Projects are at the heart of the Jenkins build process. In this chapter, we will go over the basics of a Jenkins project.

# Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

* Explain what a Jenkins project is.
* Distinguish the different types of Jenkins projects.
* Describe an anatomy of a Jenkins project.

# What Is a Jenkins Project?

**A Jenkins project is a sequential set of tasks that are defined by a user**. 

**Typical steps include retrieving the latest source code from version control, compiling it, running unit tests, building and storing the artifacts, and notifying the end users of the outcome of the build.**

On the Jenkins UI, the term "project" has been used synonymously with "job" (although "job" is now deprecated). Note that both of these are runnable tasks controlled and monitored by Jenkins.

---

# Jenkins Project Types

There are many different project types available in Jenkins including:

* Freestyle Project: This is the default project type, most flexible to configure, and is included as part of the core Jenkins.
* Maven Project: This one is useful for building Maven projects. It requires the [Maven Integration plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/maven-plugin/) to be installed.
* Pipeline and Multibranch Pipeline: These are useful for creating end-end CI/CD pipelines. These require [Pipeline](https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-aggregator/) and [Multibranch](https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-multibranch/) plugins to be installed.
* External Job: It is useful when you want to monitor a process that is running outside of Jenkins, and you would like to track its progress from the Jenkins dashboard.
* Multi-Configuration Project: This is useful for projects with a large number of configurations. It requires the [Matrix Project plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/matrix-project/) to be installed

# Anatomy of a Jenkins Project

A Jenkins project typically includes the following components.

* Global Project Options
* Source Code Management
* Build Triggers
* Build Environment
* Build
* Post-build Actions

Letâ€™s take a closer look at each of these components.

---

# Anatomy of a Jenkins Project: Global Project Options

The **General** section lists the global project options for each Jenkins project. Let's discuss what information is included.

---

### Meta-information

Meta-information is basically information about the project. For a Jenkins project, _project name_ and _project description_ are meta-information. Be sure not to input any JavaScript in the description field as it can pose a security risk.

---

### Build history management

Every time you run a Jenkins project, it stores the build log, artifacts, metadata, etc., on the disk. Over a period of time, this can take up a lot of disk space. To cap disk space consumption, you can set a build log retention by clicking the box adjacent to _Discard old builds_. Then you will be presented with two options of setting a policy for discarding builds:

* Days to keep builds
* Max # of builds to keep

Note that these two policies can be active at the same time. For example, you can keep builds for 7 days, but only up to a limit of 30 builds, as illustrated in the image below. If either limit is exceeded, then any builds beyond that limit will be discarded.

You can also set a retention policy for build artifacts by clicking the Advanced button.

Have you noticed this Question mark icon,

next to almost all the configuration fields? This is an inline form of help that Jenkins offers. Click the icon to learn more about the configuration field. Once you are done, click the icon again to hide the help text.

---

### Build management

The General section also provides configuration options for general build management. Click the _Advanced_ button to view all the options.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215468288-0ad03f81-df2b-4caa-9927-932bf6ee4d19.png)

Some of the most common configurations are listed below.

* Quiet period: Setting a wait time between builds.
* Retry Count: Setting a count for the number of times Jenkins will try to checkout from the configured SCM system until it succeeds.
* Disable this project: Disable a project if you no longer need to build it. You can always enable it if needed at a later time.

Any additional plugins you install may add to the list of global options.

# Anatomy of a Jenkins Project: Source Code Management

This is the section where you specify the details of the version control repository for building your source code. You have the flexibility to select the **SCM** tool of your choice, but be sure to install the necessary plugin.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215468660-f7c0c1b8-94e9-4e24-9eaa-4ef8257ff8ac.png)

---

# Anatomy of a Jenkins Project: Build Triggers

Jenkins allows you to trigger builds automatically. Let's take a look at some of the options under the **Build Triggers** section.

---

### Build periodically

You can schedule periodic builds using cron-like syntax. Here is an example of scheduling a build every 15 minutes.

---

### Build after other projects are built

You can also automatically build a project after another dependent project has been built successfully.

---

### Poll SCM

You can poll SCM at a certain frequency using cron-like syntax. Jenkins will poll SCM at the set times to detect new commits. If there are any, then Jenkins will go ahead and run the build.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215469198-6698a6fa-9c9a-490c-ab25-54edb5257442.png)

It is worth noting that polling adds extra overhead as it scans the entire workspace before checking with the SCM system for any new changes.

---

### Webhooks

Ideally, you would want to trigger a new build as soon as a source code change is detected so as to align with CI/CD goals. At the same time, you do not want to add polling overhead. The best way to navigate this is to let your SCM system handle it by configuring Webhooks. Here is a GitHub example describing [how to configure Webhooks](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/creating/).

---

# Anatomy of a Jenkins Project: Build Environment

The **Build Environment** section allows you to specify additional options for your builds - cleaning up the workspace prior to starting a build, setting up the required environment variables used in the build, aborting builds that are stuck, adding timestamps to the build logs, etc.

These options are provided by various plugins - [Workspace Cleanup](https://github.com/jenkinsci/ws-cleanup-plugin), [Credentials Binding](https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials-binding/), [Build Timeout](https://plugins.jenkins.io/build-timeout/) and [Timestamper](https://github.com/jenkinsci/timestamper-plugin) to name a few. The more plugins you install, the more options you will see under this section.

# Anatomy of a Jenkins Project: Build

The **Build** section comprises the actual steps to build your source code, run various tests (unit, integration, etc.), code quality, code coverage, and many more.

Note: Your source code should include the test cases, and your build tool should be able to generate the required report for it. Jenkins can be used to display build tool generated test reports and trends.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215471686-d30c8aa1-0f65-465f-93d5-04613cf77cf1.png)

Here is an example of using the _Execute shell_ build step. You can configure the shell script in any way you like. You can also make use of environment variables. For a complete list, click _See the list of available environment variables_ link. You can also set an exit code to mark the build as unstable.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215471865-8bff6961-0993-42c9-8888-c6221b78e6ed.png)

You can add one or more build steps, and re-order them however you like simply by dragging and dropping them.

You may also choose to install plugins that suit your specific needs. Such plugins can contribute to additional build steps.

---

# Anatomy of a Jenkins Project: Post-Build Actions

Post-build actions are performed based on the result of the build status. Examples include notifying developers, publishing test reports, archiving build artifacts, triggering other build projects, automated deployment, etc.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215472065-cba6facd-7671-4648-81ba-63fe2f6e6441.png)

The list of post-build steps can vary depending on the plugins installed.
