# 3. Jenkins Dashboard

# Introduction - Chapter Overview

The Jenkins dashboard is the main entry point for your Jenkins user interface. In this chapter, we will give an overview of the Jenkins dashboard - the information it displays to the end users and its core capabilities.

---

# Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

* Discuss what are the primary components of Jenkins dashboard.
* Discuss the functionality of various components.
* Navigate to different areas of the Jenkins user interface to perform various CI/CD operations.

# Dashboard Sections

The Jenkins dashboard is what you see when you first log in to the Jenkins user interface. Let's explore the dashboard and understand some of its core capabilities.

The dashboard primarily consists of the following sections:

* Header
* Side Navigation
* All View for Jobs/Projects
* Monitoring Builds
* Footer

Jenkins Dashboard

Letâ€™s take a look at each of these, starting with the header.

---

# Dashboard Sections: Header (1)

The main header includes the following components:

* Breadcrumbs
* Add/edit description
* Context search box (next page)
* Logged in user dropdown (next page)


##### **Breadcrumbs**

Breadcrumbs are a secondary navigation system that show a user's location on the Jenkins user interface. These allow you to quickly navigate to specific pages (or links) within the current hierarchy.

---

#### Add/Edit Description

You can use this to add/edit some text to the Jenkins dashboard, jobs, build, etc. The text can be a note, a reminder, or anything that can be useful to your team.

---

#### Context Search Box

The context search box lets you search for content Jenkins wide. By default, the search is case-insensitive, and it comes in very handy as you can quickly search for specific text, Jenkins jobs, builds, etc.

For example, if you need to search for build number 4 for a Jenkins job named "frontend-app", you can just type frontend-app 4.

If you need to get directly to the configuration page for this job, then you can type in frontend-app configure.

---

#### Logged in User Dropdown

At the very top-right corner of the header, you will notice a dropdown menu linked to your username.

* Builds: This displays all the builds for the user.
* Configure: This gives you the ability to configure your own settings, ssh keys, email address, custom views, and many more.
* My Views: The "All view" is the default view for all users. However, you can create your own custom view and set your default view to your custom view.
* Credentials: You can view user credentials for your own account or any other authorized credentials.

# Dashboard Sections: Side Navigation

The side navigation bar provides initial top level configuration options. At minimum, you should be able to view the default configuration items.

* New Item: This is used to create new Jenkins jobs.
* People: This lets you view/modify all the user accounts that have access to the Jenkins UI.
* Build History: Clicking this will open a new subpage, which displays the build jobs, their status, and trend.
* Manage Jenkins: This is where you can perform a variety of administration tasks such as configuring Jenkins, managing plugins, configuring global tools, security, etc.

Note that any plugins you install may add additional configuration items here. It is also worth noting that each subpage within Jenkins will have its own configuration options. For example, if you click on the Manage Jenkins link on the side navigation bar, the subpage will show the configuration options specific to Manage Jenkins.

# Dashboard Sections: All View for Jobs/Projects

This view lists every single job that is configured on the Jenkins instance. It also displays the overall state of each Jenkins job.

For a given job in this list, the following information is indicated:

* Build Status (S): Uses color codes (described below in more detail).
* Health/Build Stability (W): Uses weather icons (described below in more detail).
* Job Name
* Last Success: Displays when was the last time the job built successfully, and the related build number.
Last Failure: Displays when was the last time the build failed, and the related build number.
Last Duration: How long did the latest build take to run?
(icon)

# Dashboard Sections: Monitoring Builds

This section provides overall visibility into your Jenkins job executions. It lets you know if your Jenkins server has too many or too little resources, and can be very useful for IT capacity planning purposes. Monitoring builds has two subsections, Build Queue and Build Executor Status.

---

### Build Queue

The Build Queue section displays all the jobs that are currently queued and waiting for an executor to free up. You can click on the queued job to retrieve more information on the job. Alternatively you can cancel the job by clicking on the red colored X icon, which is displayed next to the job.

---

### Build Executor Status

The Build Executor Status lists all the builds that are currently in progress by each configured agent. You can click on the progress bar to view the build console output. You can also view the Jenkins Node dashboard which lists all the nodes (controller, agents) by clicking on the Build Executor link.

We will cover additional nodes and agents later in this course.

---

# Dashboard Sections: Page Footer

At the very bottom right corner of the Jenkins UI is a link for Rest API. This link will provide you with some basic information on how to use Rest API to programmatically interact with Jenkins. Using Rest API is an alternative to performing various operations via the Jenkins UI.
