# CI & CD Overview

# Chapter Overview


All software businesses need to deliver software in a **timely, reliable, and repeatable manner**. In this chapter, we will give an overview of **Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Deployment,** and explain how these practices help you achieve your software delivery goals.

# Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

* Explain the fundamental concepts of DevOps, Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD), and Continuous Deployment.
* Understand the basics of Continuous Delivery pipelines.
* Distinguish different tools available for CI/CD and explain why Jenkins is a good choice.

# Software Development Life Cycle

Software development follows a flow, starting with identifying new features, planning, doing the actual development, committing the source code changes, running builds and tests (unit, integration, functional, acceptance, etc.), and deploying to production.

With a traditional waterfall software delivery approach, developers could work independently for a very long time. They would not have a clue about how many issues they would run into during the integration phase.

In order to address this issue, the Agile software development model was introduced. Agile changed the way software development teams worked. **One of the key principles of this methodology was delivering working software frequently**. The focus moved to releasing incremental software, rather than big bang waterfall releases which took months and years.

**Delivering software frequently meant producing stable code for every incremental release**. It was **quite a challenge to integrate changes from various developers on the teams**. This led to software teams looking for better approaches. **Continuous Integration (CI) offered a ray of hope **and started to gain in popularity.

# Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous Integration is an agile engineering practice originating from the extreme programming methodology. **It primarily focuses on automated build and test for every change committed to the version control system by the developers.**

According to Martin Fowler,

_"Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently; usually each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day. Each integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible"._

In order to implement Continuous Integration, you will need:

* A version control system. It stores all the source code checked in by the teams, and acts as the single source of truth.
* Automated build and unit test: It is not sufficient if the code written by a developer works only on his/her machine. Every commit that makes it to the version control system should be built and tested by an independent continuous integration server.
* Feedback: Developers should get feedback on their commits. Anytime a developerâ€™s change breaks the build, they can take the necessary action (example: email notifications).
* Agreement on ways of working. It is important that everyone on the team follows the practice of checking-in incremental changes rather than waiting till they are fully developed. Their priority should be to fix any build issues that may arise with the checked-in code.
