# Prerequisites for Installing Jenkins


Prior to installing Jenkins, you need to ensure that your system at least meets minimum hardware and software requirements:

* 256MB RAM
* 1 GB of disk space (10 GB if running as a Docker container)
* Java 8 or Java 11
* Modern web browsers - Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Apple Safari.

These minimum requirements are good enough to get you started, say for dev or test purposes. However, these need to be fine-tuned for production as production systems need a lot more resources. Jenkins Documentation (https://jenkins.io/doc/book/hardware-recommendations/#hardware-recommendations) has sensible recommendations on setting the hardware requirements for your production system.

# Installation Channels

Jenkins is distributed via many channels:

* Standalone WAR
* Linux package managers (RPM, DEB, etc.)
* Windows installers
* Containers

Installing Jenkins is fairly straight forward. A typical installation takes about 10 minutes. The Jenkins installation [documentation](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/) has comprehensive instructions for using each of these channels for installation. On the next pages, we will explore installing Jenkins using each of the above-mentioned distribution channels.
