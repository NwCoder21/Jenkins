# Freestyle Projects

# Chapter Overview

In this chapter, we will go over Freestyle projects and explain how you can use them to create CI/CD workflow.

--- 

# Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

* Describe what a Jenkins Freestyle project is.
* Configure a Freestyle project.

---

# What Is a Jenkins Freestyle Project?

A Freestyle project is by far the most versatile of all the Jenkins project types. It allows you to build any type of project (Ant, Maven, Gradle, shell script, Makefile), and it is included in Jenkins by default without the need to install additional plugins.

---

# Create a New Freestyle Project

For our example Freestyle project, we will use a small Java application. We will configure all the necessary tasks for this project such as retrieving the Java source code from version control, compiling and building it, running tests, publishing the code coverage and static analysis reports and notifying the team about the status of the build.

Let’s get started.

To create a new Freestyle project, click _Dashboard_ > _New Item_ on the side navigation bar of the Jenkins dashboard.

This opens up a new subpanel listing various project types. Enter a **name** for the project, select _Freestyle_ _project_ from the list of available project types, and click _OK_.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215539399-7bc36110-7c65-497e-b51d-4ced64cb24c5.png)

This will take you to the configuration page for the new Freestyle project you have just created.

Next, we will configure our Freestyle project **java-app** to build a Maven project. [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) is a software project management tool used to build Java projects.

---

# Configure Freestyle Project (1)

The **java-app** project requires Java version 8. You can specify this dependency under the General section of **java-app** project configuration. However, you need to ensure that Java 8 is first installed on your Jenkins server.

Jenkins allows you to easily manage various tools and their versions all under _Dashboard > Manage Jenkins > Global Tool Configuration page_

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215539835-27f9e74d-186c-4fd3-9831-2f47e93bb8bb.png)

On this page, click the **Add JDK** button under the _JDK installations_ section to configure multiple JDK versions.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215539955-0f1ad55e-a4e1-4149-89a8-12d19fa4704b.png)

# Configure Freestyle Project (2)

Next, follow these steps:

* Add a Name for the Java version you are trying to install.
* Check the toggle for Install automatically.
* Choose the JDK Version from the dropdown.
* Enter the credentials for your Oracle account.
* Check the License Agreement checkbox.
* Click Save.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215540220-9aae89ef-8af2-4cce-ad02-b93c9dea5a4b.png)

Note that you can also use other Installers to install different versions of JDK. Just click the downward arrow on the _Add Installer_ dropdown to view all the available options.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215540303-99d8744c-f812-4120-8d0e-6d3ba9fa99e7.png)

You will have to add at least two JDK tool versions in order for them to show up under JDK versions in the _General_ section of your java-app project configuration page.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215540456-76aa820e-cdd8-447c-a55f-c83f4a9b20a1.png)

# Source Code Management (1)

To build the java-app project, you need to fetch its source code from a version control system.

First, create your own repository:

* The source code for the Java app is hosted in a GitHub repository (click here to create your own GitHub repository)
* Enter the Repository name
* Enter an optional Description
* Set it to Private
* Click Create repository from template

Below is an illustration showing how to create your own repository.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215540696-c65dbef6-e3dd-49f4-bc58-8d65d3f3ccac.png)

Next, we need to configure the Git repository under the SCM section of the demoapp-freestyle project:

* Scroll down to the Source Code Management section.
* Select "Git".
* Enter Repository URL (enter your GitHub repository URL).
* Select Credentials to authenticate to the SCM repository.
* Click Add > Jenkins to add the SCM credentials.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215540816-4d054124-0998-421d-9cb2-f5a5409693d2.png)

There are a number of ways to add credentials. We will cover this in a later section of the course. For now, you can choose to configure your **SSH Username with private key** credential as shown below.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215540917-2d132789-050b-4eb6-b281-1bd1e237acd6.png)

# Source Code Management (2)

NOTE on the SSH Key: You will need to create a SSH key locally on your machine if you don't already have one, and then add the SSH key to your GitHub account.

* Here's more information on how to [check if you have an existing SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys).
* Here's information on [how to generate a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).
* Here's information on [how to add your SSH key to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).
* Once you are done setting up your SSH key, you can configure the credentials.

Make sure to select _SSH Username_ with _private key_ for the credentials kind. Enter the private portion of your key (id_rsa file content) under the _Private Key _section.

Once the credentials are added, you can view and select them from the credentials dropdown list.

For our **java-app** project, we will select the **master** branch.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215541530-8e2434ed-43bb-4a0e-b5ed-4a82bb036745.png)

NOTE: You can also choose a specific branch in a repository, a repository browser, and advanced options for integrating with your repository.

Click _Save_ to save your SCM configuration.

Next, we will configure the build triggers for our **java-app** project.

---

# Build Triggers

For our **java-app** project, we will use **Poll SCM** build trigger and set the polling to every 15 minutes.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215811544-9bc0ff78-32f1-40f2-824d-0c7f1a92b5dd.png)

---

# Build Environment

We will just add a timestamp to the build console output. To enable this, check the toggle for Add timestamps to the Console Output.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215812902-4fbf109a-e783-4a7c-97a3-ad0a463957a8.png)

---

 # Build
 
In this section, we will compile and build our **java-app** project, run tests, and generate the required reports for code quality and code coverage.

We will start with adding a build step, _Add build step_ > _Invoke top-level Maven targets_.
 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215814040-13f7e001-ac85-4c5d-aac5-37e2a4c867ef.png)
 
This will add a new build step and configure it as follows:

_Maven Version: maven3_

Note that we are using Maven version 3. To use this version, you need to install the Maven 3 version via _Dashboard_ > _Manage Jenkins_ > _Global Tool Configuration_.

_Goals: clean verify site_

A note on the options:
* clean: will wipe out any existing compiled sources in the target directory and start the build from a clean state
* verify: will run any checks to verify the package is valid and meets quality criteria
* site: will generate java-app project code coverage and static analysis reports

Next, click on the **Advanced** button.
 
 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215814993-e1186020-313a-4646-9ae4-5b64d81dd340.png)

This will display additional configuration options. We will just specify the location of the [POM](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-pom.html) file.
_
POM: java-demo-app/pom.xml_

Leave all other fields set to their default values. 
 
 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215815202-98fd649f-3329-47af-9556-b3d50fa44e82.png)

Click _Save_ to save your configuration.

We are done configuring the build step. Next, we will configure the post-build actions.
 
 ---
 
#  Post-Build Actions
 
 For our **java-app** project, we will configure the following post-build actions:

* Archive the build artifacts so we can use them later.
* View code coverage trends so we can see the percentage of code that is executed as part of the tests.
* View static analysis trends so we can measure the code defects.
* Notify the team on the build status so that developers and team members can get quick feedback on the build, and take any necessary actions.

Let's learn more.
 
 ---
 
 # Post-Build Actions: Archive Build Artifacts
 
Our **java-app** project generates a [Java ARchive (JAR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAR_(file_format)) file. To archive the file for later use, choose _Add post-build action > Archive the artifacts_...
 
 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215816296-cf6bb132-d511-4e5b-93bb-d287150064bd.png)

 ...and specify the location of the JAR file.

_Files to to archive: **/target/*.jar_

This will look for all files with **.jar** extension recursively under all target directories from the workspace’s root.
 
 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215816494-c5805a5d-a1ed-4cf6-b72a-cadece7c2d21.png)

 Next, we will configure publishing the code coverage reports that are generated as part of the build step.
 
 ---
 
 # Post-Build Actions: Publish Code Coverage Report
 
For our **java-app** project, we are using J[aCoCo](https://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/), a code coverage tool for Java. To enable publishing JaCoCo reports, you first need to install the [JaCoCo](https://plugins.jenkins.io/jacoco/) plugin. This will add a new option to record code coverage reports under post-build actions.
 
 Next, choose _Add post-build action > Record JaCoCo coverage report_.
 
 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215817091-768c68df-60e3-4725-8861-23adad4c1300.png)

Configure the following and leave all other fields set to their default values:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215817170-c11056de-386d-49bc-a1cc-e0223953d0ac.png)

Next, we will add a new step to publish static analysis reports. 

---

# Post-Build Actions: Static Analysis Reports (1)

Our **java-app** project uses the following two tools: [SpotBugs](https://spotbugs.github.io/) and [PMD](https://pmd.github.io/). Both of which help detect defects in Java code.

First, ensure that the [Warnings Next Generation plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/warnings-ng/) is installed. Upon plugin installation, you will be able to view a new option to record your static analysis reports under **post-build actions**.

Choose _Add post-build action > Record compiler warnings and static analysis results_.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215818421-c3acebca-206d-4ffc-b99b-1f311cceecd2.png)

From the drop down Tool menu, select _SpotBugs_. Set **Report Encoding** to UTF-8. Leave all other fields set to their default values.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215818515-0ce60af8-b8f0-4fec-9175-8a319bac4562.png)

---

# Post-Build Actions: Static Analysis Reports (2)

Next, we will add the second tool - **PMD**. Under the configuration for _Static Analysis Tools_, click _Add Tool_.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215818732-42d8576d-4c25-4d0c-aea1-2f3ab9803dfd.png)

Select PMD from the tool dropdown. Set **Report Encoding** to UTF-8. Leave all other fields set to their default values.  

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215818841-a298d3b3-ff86-4348-ac3d-67f68c55b8bd.png)

Finally, we will configure email notifications for our **java-app** project.

---

# Post-Build Actions: Email Notifications

Jenkins provides out of the box email support to send notifications to team members.

Choose _Add Post-build action > Email Notification_, and specify the target recipients for the emails. This is illustrated below.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215819033-bc406605-6679-40bf-b3f7-42ea3334feec.png)

You might want to take a look at the [Email Extension](https://plugins.jenkins.io/email-ext/) plugin, if you are looking to customize your email notifications.

Click _Save_ to save your configuration.

We are now done configuring the **java-app** freestyle project. It’s time to start a new build and see things in action!

---

# Build History

Click _Build Now_ on the side navigation of the _java-app_ project to trigger a new build.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215819466-97c559cd-fc36-440a-9eb0-8c07f11c64ea.png)

Once the build is completed, you should be able to view all the relevant information such as build number, build date, SCM changes, name of the user who started the build, console output, artifacts, code coverage report, static analysis report, etc.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215819549-f0bd57bb-85bf-44cd-9d50-9cd8966c932d.png)

When you run this project more than once, you can view the build history, code coverage and static analysis trends, etc., on the **java-app** project page.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215819648-0f3e1953-0564-4901-b5de-8fd5b4ddc167.png)
