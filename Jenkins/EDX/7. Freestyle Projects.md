# Freestyle Projects

# Chapter Overview

In this chapter, we will go over Freestyle projects and explain how you can use them to create CI/CD workflow.

# Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

* Describe what a Jenkins Freestyle project is.
* Configure a Freestyle project.

---

# What Is a Jenkins Freestyle Project?

A Freestyle project is by far the most versatile of all the Jenkins project types. It allows you to build any type of project (Ant, Maven, Gradle, shell script, Makefile), and it is included in Jenkins by default without the need to install additional plugins.

---

# Create a New Freestyle Project

For our example Freestyle project, we will use a small Java application. We will configure all the necessary tasks for this project such as retrieving the Java source code from version control, compiling and building it, running tests, publishing the code coverage and static analysis reports and notifying the team about the status of the build.

Letâ€™s get started.

To create a new Freestyle project, click _Dashboard_ > _New Item_ on the side navigation bar of the Jenkins dashboard.

This opens up a new subpanel listing various project types. Enter a **name** for the project, select _Freestyle_ _project_ from the list of available project types, and click _OK_.

This will take you to the configuration page for the new Freestyle project you have just created.

Next, we will configure our Freestyle project **java-app** to build a Maven project. [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) is a software project management tool used to build Java projects.

---

# Configure Freestyle Project (1)

The **java-app** project requires Java version 8. You can specify this dependency under the General section of **java-app** project configuration. However, you need to ensure that Java 8 is first installed on your Jenkins server.

Jenkins allows you to easily manage various tools and their versions all under _Dashboard > Manage Jenkins > Global Tool Configuration page_

On this page, click the **Add JDK** button under the _JDK installations_ section to configure multiple JDK versions.

# Configure Freestyle Project (2)

Next, follow these steps:

* Add a Name for the Java version you are trying to install.
* Check the toggle for Install automatically.
* Choose the JDK Version from the dropdown.
* Enter the credentials for your Oracle account.
* Check the License Agreement checkbox.
* Click Save.

Note that you can also use other Installers to install different versions of JDK. Just click the downward arrow on the _Add Installer_ dropdown to view all the available options.

You will have to add at least two JDK tool versions in order for them to show up under JDK versions in the _General_ section of your java-app project configuration page.

# Source Code Management (1)

To build the java-app project, you need to fetch its source code from a version control system.

First, create your own repository:

* The source code for the Java app is hosted in a GitHub repository (click here to create your own GitHub repository)
* Enter the Repository name
* Enter an optional Description
* Set it to Private
* Click Create repository from template

Below is an illustration showing how to create your own repository.

Next, we need to configure the Git repository under the SCM section of the demoapp-freestyle project:

* Scroll down to the Source Code Management section.
* Select "Git".
* Enter Repository URL (enter your GitHub repository URL).
* Select Credentials to authenticate to the SCM repository.
* Click Add > Jenkins to add the SCM credentials.

There are a number of ways to add credentials. We will cover this in a later section of the course. For now, you can choose to configure your **SSH Username with private key** credential as shown below.

# Source Code Management (2)

NOTE on the SSH Key: You will need to create a SSH key locally on your machine if you don't already have one, and then add the SSH key to your GitHub account.

* Here's more information on how to [check if you have an existing SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys).
* Here's information on [how to generate a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).
* Here's information on [how to add your SSH key to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).
* Once you are done setting up your SSH key, you can configure the credentials.

Make sure to select _SSH Username_ with _private key_ for the credentials kind. Enter the private portion of your key (id_rsa file content) under the _Private Key _section.

Once the credentials are added, you can view and select them from the credentials dropdown list.

For our **java-app** project, we will select the **master** branch.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215541530-8e2434ed-43bb-4a0e-b5ed-4a82bb036745.png)

NOTE: You can also choose a specific branch in a repository, a repository browser, and advanced options for integrating with your repository.

Click _Save_ to save your SCM configuration.

Next, we will configure the build triggers for our **java-app** project.
