# 8. Pipeline Projects

# Chapter Overview

In this chapter, we will go over Pipeline projects and explain how you can use them to create CI/CD workflows.

---

# Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

* Explain what a Pipeline project is.
* Configure a Pipeline workflow.

---

# Freestyle vs Pipeline Projects

You should have noticed by now that Jenkins is mostly UI-centric, meaning all the projects are manually configured through the UI. If you recall from Chapter 1, Continuous Delivery heavily relies on seamless end-to-end automation. Although Freestyle projects provide you with a lot of flexibility to configure projects, they are not quite suitable to orchestrate complex CD scenarios. For example, if you want to build and test on a variety of OS platforms in parallel, or when you are waiting for some manual approval prior to deployment, etc.

Although you can create project hierarchies with Freestyle projects for representing multi-stage workflows, such strategy requires you to spread project configuration across multiple projects. Thus making it difficult to manage and maintain them as a simple change in one project might adversely affect the others. But that's not all, you might find it challenging to visualize a workflow spanning multiple Freestyle projects.

This is where Jenkins Pipelines come to your rescue by helping you:

* Create a set of instructions written as a code to model complex workflows.
* Provide a single-place visualization of different stages of your workflow.
* Keep all the Pipeline code stored in SCM, so you can apply SCM best practices such as versioning, tracking and auditing to the project configuration itself.

# Pipelines

Pipeline is a new Jenkins project type and a new way to model and visualize CI/CD workflow for a project. It is created by writing a bunch of instructions in a file called **Jenkinsfile**. The Jenkins Pipeline uses a domain-specific language based on [Apache Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org/) to create, edit, view, and run CD pipelines.

A Jenkinsfile can use either of the following two syntaxes:

* Declarative Pipelines: They require the [Blue Ocean](https://plugins.jenkins.io/blueocean/) plugin to be installed. You can easily create your Jenkinsfile using the Blue Ocean graphical pipeline editor. It also provides you with a great visualization of your pipeline runs.
* Scripted Pipelines: With scripted pipelines, you have the option of creating the Jenkinsfile using the classic Jenkins UI. This means you will be creating the Jenkins project using the Pipeline project type. While scripted pipelines offer a lot of flexibility, they also require you to have a knowledge of **Apache Groovy**.

It is worth noting that there is a lot of commonality in the syntactical components between declarative and scripted pipelines.

It is best to start out with declarative pipelines, and as you get comfortable with them, you can move on to scripted pipelines. For the remainder of this chapter, we will focus on declarative pipelines.

---

# Pipelines Terminology

Prior to creating Pipelines, you need to know a few basic pipeline-related terms. Let's take a look at them:

* Controller: A machine where Jenkins is installed. It centrally stores all the configurations, loads plugins and renders the Jenkins UI.
* Agent: A machine which connects to the Jenkins Controller and performs various operations as directed by the Jenkins Controller.
* Node: A machine that can allocate an executor and run Jenkins Pipelines. Examples are Jenkins Controllers and Agents.
* Step: A single task that tells Jenkins what to do at a given point in time. Examples include: executing a simple shell script and windows batch script.
* Stage: It is composed of logically distinct steps. Build, Test, Deploy are all examples of Stages. Stages are used for visualization of the Pipeline status/progress.

For a complete list of pipeline-related terms, see Jenkins' [Pipeline Glossary](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/glossary/).

# Creating a Pipeline

We will now talk about creating pipelines using the Blue Ocean graphical editor. Let's start by creating a Pipeline to simulate a CI/CD workflow with the following set of stages:

* Build: In this stage, source code is compiled and built, and an artifact is generated.
* Test: In this stage, tests will be run in parallel on two different OS platforms, Linux and Windows.
* Deploy Staging: In this stage, the artifacts will be deployed to a staging environment (essentially a pre-production server). If everything is good, we will request for approval to deploy to production.
* Deploy Production: In this stage, artifacts will be deployed to the production environment.

We will also configure two post-build actions:

* Archive build artifacts
* Email notification in case of a build failure

Let's get started with creating the Pipeline.

--- 

# Creating a Pipeline: Open the Blue Ocean Editor

Once you install the [Blue Ocean plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/blueocean/), you should be able to view the _Open Blue Ocean _link on the side navigation. Click on this link to navigate to the Blue Ocean UI.

Note that Jenkins officially supports the latest versions of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer, and Apple Safari web browsers. However, Chrome and Firefox seem to be the most consistent performers.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215996174-4ca09ead-95f4-4a89-adb0-d42060892818.png)

In the Blue Ocean UI, click **Create a new Pipeline**. If you don’t see this option, select **New Pipeline** in the top-right corner.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215996330-934e421b-8f64-41f7-b9ac-52df6c751d90.png)

# Creating a Pipeline: Configure SCM (1)

Next, you will see a screen prompting you to configure your source code repository.

The source code for the pipeline project is hosted in a GitHub repository. This repository includes all the required build scripts. Click [here](https://github.com/dhgautam/demoapp-pipeline-template/generate) to create your own GitHub repository.

* Sign in to GitHub
* Enter the **Repository name**
* Enter an optional Description
* Set it to **Private**
* Click **Create repository from template**

The following screenshot illustrates how to create your own repository.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215996819-2c67f8b6-f634-4a0e-875e-0c001b751940.png)

Once you have set up your own repository, you are ready to proceed with the next steps to create your Pipeline. Determine:

* Where do you store your code?
* How do you connect to your Git repository?

Based on your SCM preference, you can choose how you would like to connect to your SCM repository. Let’s take a look at two different ways to connect Git repositories.

Choosing Git:

* Choose **Git** for _Where do you store your code_?
* Enter the **Repository URL**
* Click **Copy to clipboard** to copy the SSH key (be sure to register the SSH key onto your Git server)
* And finally, click the **Create Pipeline** button.

---

# Creating a Pipeline: Configure SCM (2)

An illustration of choosing Git is shown in the figure below.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216000609-d29cbb4e-8d95-4872-9582-c365c4236c68.png)


* Choose **GitHub** for _Where do you store your code_?
* Next, enter your GitHub access token. If you do not have one, click on **Create an access token here** link. Be sure to copy the token.

Click on the **Connect** button.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216000832-45fd1758-706b-470f-bbc6-d70b2a5d1310.png)

---

# Creating a Pipeline: Configure SCM (3)

Next, choose a **GitHub Organization** the repository belongs to. An illustration is shown in the figure below.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216000972-9d21ccc5-f382-42e8-a24f-e10734e8fcff.png)

Next, choose the repository that you want to use for this project. This is the repository you set up from the template earlier.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216001091-22b7d301-5d7c-4e44-ab05-56a360edbab3.png)

And finally, click on the **Create Pipeline** button.

---

# Creating a Pipeline: Configure SCM (4)

If you put these steps together, your configuration should look similar to this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216008506-f1ec151c-448b-4727-a8ff-00d93477a2dc.png)

Since this is the first time you are creating a Pipeline, you will see a pop up message stating that there are no Jenkinsfiles in the SCM repository. Once you create and configure your Pipeline, its configuration code will get stored in the SCM repository as a Jenkinsfile.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216008600-edba7d65-f0ed-4c4a-b4e4-e8c0692e5ae4.png)

Next, we will go ahead and configure the various stages for our Pipeline.

---

# Creating a Pipeline: Build Stage

If you recall Pipeline terminology, stages are composed of steps. As part of the Build stage, we will add two steps.

*  Print Message: This will print **Build demo-app**
*  Shell Script: This will run a build shell script

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216009037-2ab1275e-29b3-4a18-b1e5-2151a44112ef.png)

This will open a configuration panel for the new stage. Enter "Build" for Name your stage. Click on the Add step button below which opens the Choose step type panel.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216009616-ed35b5a8-2b2a-4f95-8acf-242d321ae786.png)

In this panel, choose the _Print Message_ step. This will open the _Print Message_ configuration panel.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216010139-0edf02d3-0952-457a-914d-649de3a102aa.png)

Enter **Build Demo Application** for the value, and click the top-left back arrow icon (←) to return to the main Pipeline editor.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216010264-d6ed4369-9dc7-4641-be0a-22565e54ecd9.png)

Next, we will add another step to incorporate our build script. Choose _Shell Script_ from _Choose Step type_. This will open the _Shell script configuration_ panel.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216010436-cd0a75a5-5255-4a1f-961a-5d6ed2c57c81.png)

Enter **sh run_build_script.sh** in the configuration panel.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216010589-f25e5b56-55ea-4766-bce2-c44076d03c81.png)

This completes the Build stage configuration.

---

# Creating a Pipeline: Test Stage

Next, we will add two parallel stages: Linux Tests and Windows Tests.

### Linux Tests Stage

In the Pipeline editor, click the + icon next to the Build stage to add a new stage. This will open a configuration panel for the new stage. Enter "Linux Tests" for _Name your stage_ and click on the _Add step_ button below, which opens the _Choose step type_ panel.

We will add two steps similar to the build stage.

* Print Message: Specify **Run Linux tests** in its configuration panel.
* Shell Script: Specify **sh run_linux_tests.sh** in its configuration panel.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216011391-6cbed566-6b1c-4f5b-9bdb-d2e347caab71.png)

Next, click the + icon below the Linux Tests stage to create a parallel Windows Tests stage.

### Windows Tests Stage

As part of this stage, we will just configure a single step **Print Message**, and specify _Run Windows tests_ in its configuration panel.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216012503-396473be-23f9-4d0b-aa66-348da3d0814f.png)

Once both tests are successfully run, we will deploy the artifacts to a staging environment. Click the + icon next to the Linux Tests stage to add a new stage and specify "Deploy Staging" for the name.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216012719-43cdfa84-c7c1-4cf0-809b-62d7f6dd8b37.png)

---

# Creating a Pipeline: Deploy a Staging Stage (1)

As part of this stage, we will add two steps.

The first step is Print Message. Specify _Deploy to staging environment_ in its configuration panel.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216013951-856365f6-f306-4fa1-b845-359428ecb22e.png)

lease note that it's a common practice to seek approval prior to deploying in a production environment. And while deploying to the staging environment cannot be accomplished in the Freestyle project, we can easily add this as a step in our Pipeline project.

In order to do that, click on _Add Step_ and choose _Wait for interactive input_ step from _Choose step type_. Note that the list of step types can be long. You may want to use the search filter available on the _Choose step type_ panel to quickly find the step.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216014968-ca29f019-56a4-4d08-936e-e9fe37c54af9.png)

---

# Creating a Pipeline: Deploy a Staging Stage (2)

In the _Deploy Staging / Wait for interactive input_ panel, specify _Ok to deploy to production_? in the Message field. Leave other settings with their default values. Click the top-left back arrow icon (←) to return to the Pipeline stage editor.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216015324-75eb2e4e-35af-4532-a91d-35a42b1fa687.png)

Next, we will configure the Deploy Production stage, which is the last stage in the Pipeline. Click the + icon next to the Deploy Staging stage to add a new stage.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216015466-ab9c1117-91b0-4a89-a3c8-79e8aa92877c.png)

Specify _Deploy Production_ for the name.

---

# Creating a Pipeline: Deploy a Production Stage

As part of this stage, we will add a single step, Print Message, and specify Deploy to Prod in its configuration panel.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216015831-52f73d78-0cad-49a2-901b-81d719a94909.png)

---

# Creating a Pipeline: Post-Build Actions (1)

At the time of this writing, the post-build actions cannot be configured through the UI. You need to add them to the Jenkinsfile directly. You can open Jenkinsfile from the Pipeline editor by clicking Command+S on MacOS, Ctrl+S on Windows, or the equivalent on other operating systems.

Add the following code snippet after the stages block to archive build artifacts, and send out an email notification in case of a build failure. Please be sure to replace the email address in the code block.

```
post {
  always {
   archiveArtifacts(artifacts: 'target/demoapp.jar', fingerprint: true)
  }

failure {
      mail to: 'YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS',
      subject: "Failed Pipeline ${currentBuild.fullDisplayName}",
      body: " For details about the failure, see ${env.BUILD_URL}"
     }
  }
```

Click on the _Update_ button to update the Jenkinsfile for our pipeline project.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216016167-03a64996-0612-48be-8b89-6f21a606185c.png)

Your Jenkinsfile should look like [this](https://gist.github.com/dhgautam/634aa9f16559b40791a28953da6494d3).

```java
pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {
    stage('Build') {
      steps {
        echo 'Build demo-app'
        sh 'sh run_build_script.sh'
      }
    }

    stage('Linux Tests') {
      parallel {
        stage('Linux Tests') {
          steps {
            echo 'Run Linux tests'
            sh 'sh run_linux_tests.sh'
          }
        }

        stage('Windows Tests') {
          steps {
            echo 'Run Windows tests'
          }
        }

      }
    }

    stage('Deploy Staging') {
      steps {
        echo 'Deploy to staging environment'
        input 'Ok to deploy to production?'
      }
    }

    stage('Deploy Production') {
      post {
        always {
          archiveArtifacts(artifacts: 'target/demoapp.jar', fingerprint: true)
        }

        failure {
          emailext(subject: 'Demoapp build failure', to: 'ci-team@example.com', body: 'Build failure for demoapp Build ${env.JOB_NAME} ')
        }

      }
      steps {
        echo 'Deploy to Prod'
      }
    }

  }
}
```

Click on the _Save_ button at the top right to save your Pipeline configuration.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216017042-6f1ff50e-244d-43b4-8098-c6c654b041bc.png)

In the _Save Pipeline_ dialog box, specify the commit message _First Pipeline_ in the _Description_ field. Leave all other fields set to their default values.

---

# Creating a Pipeline: Post-Build Actions (2)

Click _Save & run_ to run your pipeline. This will accomplish the following:

* Jenkinsfile which contains your Pipeline code will be committed to the master branch of the Git repository. You can also specify any other branch. If the branch does not exist, one will be created automatically.
* Jenkins will queue the Pipeline project.
* It will start executing the first stage (Build) defined in our Pipeline.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216017498-ec6f1872-7921-4099-9df3-a2c37b5a02b5.png)

When the main Blue Ocean interface appears, click on the row to see Jenkins build your pipeline project.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216017599-df84ffa6-a996-4740-92e7-44fee78a5785.png)

At the very end of the Deploy Staging stage, you will be asked to decide if it is _OK to deploy to Production_? Click on the _Proceed button_ to advance to the Deploy Production stage.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216017721-b6876a32-01d5-418e-b50b-d1d41863c590.png)

# Creating a Pipeline: Pipeline Visualization

The Blue Ocean UI displays different colors based on the status of a Pipeline run...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216017854-40afacec-6779-47d9-b6c3-d45756d4a64a.png)

...and a weather icon for the build trend.

Upon a successful pipeline build run, you will notice that the Blue Ocean interface turns green.

You will also be able to view the various stages of your pipeline project as well as different steps, build metrics and download logs per stage—all displayed in one place. In case there is an issue with a certain stage, you can restart this specific stage without having to re-run the entire pipeline.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216017985-bb05053a-a94b-4c8d-9695-f3659bb7cdb8.png)

In this chapter, we have only scratched the surface of Jenkins Pipelines. In reality, Pipelines allow you to orchestrate much more complex applications.
