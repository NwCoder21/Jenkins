# What is Jenkinsfile?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216024448-289ebf02-f6fc-478a-90f1-00393c22dcfc.png)

Normally, in Jenkins, we would create new jobs and configure them. However, instead of creating and configuring jobs using the Jenkins User Interface, Jenkinsfile allows us to write a file (in other words, script a build and its configuration in a file) named `Jenkinsfile`.

* Jenkinsfile is Pipeline as a Code (a scripted pipeline). 
* The Jenkinsfile is created in your repository. 

---

The first step is to create a Jenkinsfile in your repository. Call it `Jenkinsfile`.

```jenkinsfile
pipeline {

    agent any

    stages {

        stage('Build') {

            steps {
               
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The above is a boilerplate for a Jenkisfile.

A Jenkinsfile can be written as a Scripted Pipeline or a Declarative Pipeline. 

---

# Scripted Pipeline

The Scripted Pipeline was the first syntax of `Jenkinsfile`. It allows you to write the whole configuration of the Jenkinsfile using groovy script. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216028277-2b9cfc45-d0ec-4060-a9a2-258a272901ba.png)

This means the only structure that you have in a Scripted Pipeline is the above screenshot and inside of it you have groovy scripts and you can write the whole configuration here in a flexible manner as you wish so there is no predefined structure. However, for
people who know groovy syntax or who havent' worked with groovy, it can be a  little difficult to start with.

# Declarative Pipeline

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216029830-24478da5-ef6e-4ecf-8cc8-6fe8365b3c2a.png)

This is why more recently and new type of pipeline was introduced called Declarative Pipeline. It is easier to get started with but it is not as powerful as the Scripted Pipeline. The reason why it is easier to get started with is because there is a predefined structure, which is ...

This is basically pre-given structure that you have to follow but you don't have to think about how to script all of this, you just need to fill in the gaps in each section.

# Required Fields of a Jenkinsfile


```
node {
    // groovy script 
}
```

is the same as:

```
pipeline {

    agent any
```

---


In a Declarative Pipeline, you declare that you are writing a: 
* `pipeline {` must be at the top (top-level)
* `agent` -  this means this buildwill run on any available Jenkins agent. An agent can be a node, it can be executors on that node and this is more relevant to when you have a Jenkins cluster so to say with master and slaves where you have Windows nodes and Linux nodes etc. For basic scripts we use `agent any`.

> The first two, `pipeline` and `agent any`, are required attributes. This means you always have to use them.

*  `stages` this is the next required attribute. This is where all the "work" happens. This contains all the different stages of the pipeline. 

```
stages {

        stage('Build') {

            steps {
               
            }
```

Within `stages`, you define the stage name, such as  `stage('Build') {`. Within `stages`, you can define as many `stage`/steps as you want. For example, 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216032691-a39c31fd-7173-40e4-84d3-bfa877f9e344.png)

```
pipeline {

    agent any

    stages {

        stage('Build') {

            steps {
               
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {

            steps {
               
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {

            steps {
               
            }
        }
    }
}
```

* `steps` : within `steps` goes the script that actually executes some command on the Jenkins server or Jenkins agent. For example:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216036888-2437b5a7-1647-4fc3-af4c-898e0ad4be30.png)

```
pipeline {

    agent any

    stages {

        stage('Build') {

            steps {
               echo 'Building the application'
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {

            steps {
               echo 'Testing the application'
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {

            steps {
               echo 'Deploying the application'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This is now a valid Jenkinsfile. We can then save it in the repository. When we run this Jenkinsfile, it will echo out a couple of statements.

Add the name and choose `Multibranch Pipeline`. Then click `OK`.

Scroll down to `Branch Sources` and `Add Source`. Add `GitHub` and its `Repository HTTPS URL` and the `Credentials`.

In the `Behaviours` section, it is asking which branches we want to build. I will leave it as `Discover branches` and `All branches get the same properties`. Then click `Apply` and then `Save`.

Then to run, click on `Scan Repository Log`.This scans all the branches for the Jenkinsfile. `Scheduled build for branch: main 
1 branches were processed` tells us the `main` branch was built. To check that out ...

click on `main`.

We can see that the stages we defined in the Jenkinsfile.

If we click on the logs for each stage, it outputs what we echoed in the Jenkinsfile.

How is it configured that my pipeline looks for the Jenkinsfile in those projects? The below configuers this setting so it looks for the Jenkinsfile.
