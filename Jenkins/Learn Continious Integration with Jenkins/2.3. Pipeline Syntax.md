# Jenkinsfile 

# What is Jenkinsfile?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216024448-289ebf02-f6fc-478a-90f1-00393c22dcfc.png)

Normally, in Jenkins, we would create new jobs and configure them. However, instead of creating and configuring jobs using the Jenkins User Interface, Jenkinsfile allows us to write a file (in other words, script a build and its configuration in a file) named `Jenkinsfile`.

* Jenkinsfile is Pipeline as a Code (a scripted pipeline). 
* The Jenkinsfile is created in your repository. 

---

The first step is to create a Jenkinsfile in your repository. Call it `Jenkinsfile`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216026142-a54e910b-cdcd-404c-bc82-eef3fa799bf3.png)

```jenkinsfile
pipeline {

    agent any

    stages {

        stage('Build') {

            steps {
               
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The above is a boilerplate for a Jenkisfile.

A Jenkinsfile can be written as a Scripted Pipeline or a Declarative Pipeline. 

---

# Scripted Pipeline

The Scripted Pipeline was the first syntax of `Jenkinsfile`. It allows you to write the whole configuration of the Jenkinsfile using groovy script. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216028277-2b9cfc45-d0ec-4060-a9a2-258a272901ba.png)

This means the only structure that you have in a Scripted Pipeline is the above screenshot and inside of it you have groovy scripts and you can write the whole configuration here in a flexible manner as you wish so there is no predefined structure. However, for
people who know groovy syntax or who havenâ€™t worked with groovy, it can be a  little difficult to start with.

---

# Declarative Pipeline

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216029830-24478da5-ef6e-4ecf-8cc8-6fe8365b3c2a.png)

This is why more recently, and new type of pipeline was introduced called Declarative Pipeline. It is easier to get started with but it is not as powerful as the Scripted Pipeline. The reason why it is easier to get started with, is because there is a predefined structure, which is ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216026142-a54e910b-cdcd-404c-bc82-eef3fa799bf3.png)

This is basically pre-given structure that you have to follow but you don't have to think about how to script all of this, you just need to fill in the gaps in each section. 

---

# Required Fields of a Jenkinsfile


```
node {
    // groovy script 
}
```

is the same as:

```
pipeline {

    agent any
```

---


In a Declarative Pipeline, you declare that you are writing a: 
* `pipeline {` must be at the top (top-level)
* `agent` - this means this build will run on any available Jenkins agent. An agent can be a node, it can be executors on that node, and this is more relevant to when you have a Jenkins cluster so to say with master and slaves where you have Windows nodes and Linux nodes etc. For basic scripts we use `agent any`.

> The first two, `pipeline` and `agent any`, are required attributes. This means you always have to use them.

*  `stages` this is the next required attribute. This is where all the "work" happens. This contains all the different stages of the pipeline. 

```
stages {

        stage('Build') {

            steps {
               
            }
```

Within `stages`, you define the stage name, such as `stage('Build') {`. Within `stages`, you can define as many `stage`/steps as you want. For example, 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216032691-a39c31fd-7173-40e4-84d3-bfa877f9e344.png)

```
pipeline {

    agent any

    stages {

        stage('Build') {

            steps {
               
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {

            steps {
               
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {

            steps {
               
            }
        }
    }
}
```

* `steps`: within `steps` goes the script that actually executes some command on the Jenkins server or Jenkins agent. For example:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216036888-2437b5a7-1647-4fc3-af4c-898e0ad4be30.png)

```
pipeline {

    agent any

    stages {

        stage('Build') {

            steps {
               echo 'Building the application'
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {

            steps {
               echo 'Testing the application'
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {

            steps {
               echo 'Deploying the application'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This is now a valid Jenkinsfile. We can then save it in the repository. When we run this Jenkinsfile, it will echo out a couple of statements.

Add the name and choose `Multibranch Pipeline`. Then click `OK`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216052824-cd782f15-b1ee-4e70-92f8-959d8eee8951.png)

Scroll down to `Branch Sources` and `Add Source`. Add `GitHub` and its `Repository HTTPS URL` and the `Credentials`. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216051772-32c18e75-c78f-4084-bcfc-572cac6a4df5.png)

In the `Behaviours` section, it is asking which branches we want to build. I will leave it as `Discover branches` and `All branches get the same properties`. Then click `Apply` and then `Save`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216053487-f9e7799f-0398-45c2-acb5-9949405ceba2.png)

Then to run, click on `Scan Repository Log`. This scans all the branches for the Jenkinsfile. `Scheduled build for branch: main 
1 branches were processed` tells us the `main` branch was built. To check that out ...

We can see that the stages we defined in the Jenkinsfile. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216054572-e206c4c4-8cfc-4586-bd60-531213a64f67.png)

If we click on the logs for each stage, it outputs what we echoed in the Jenkinsfile.

... configuration. This implicitly defines the first stage of the pipeline which is checking out the code.

---

Question: how is it configured so that my pipeline looks for the Jenkinsfile in this project? The below configures this setting (`Script Path`) so it looks for a file called Jenkinsfile.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216056109-43204b57-8b50-4bff-9f44-58c7844ec706.png)

This is all you need to do in order to configure a pipeline to build from Jenkins file. The rest of the configuration of individual steps of build pipeline will be done in a Jenkins file itself.
 

---

# Post Attribute in Jenkinsfile

Let's go back to the Jenkinsfile and see what attributes we can use to configure different parts of the build. The below is the basic syntax where we have the base construct inside stages where we defined three different stages:

```
pipeline {

    agent any

    stages {

        stage('Build') {

            steps {
               echo 'Building the application'
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {

            steps {
               echo 'Testing the application'
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {

            steps {
               echo 'Deploying the application'
            }
        }
    }
}
```
---

Another thing we can do in a `Jenkinsfile` is that at the end of it you can define post attribute. This means it executes some kind of logic/scripts after all the stages are done.

```
post {

}
```

Inside the `post` there are different conditions that you can execute. For example:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216070981-48b2cbdb-2976-4623-8bbd-d39e54974d60.png)

```
pipeline {

    agent any

    stages {

        stage('Build') {

            steps {
               echo 'Building the application'
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {

            steps {
               echo 'Testing the application'
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {

            steps {
               echo 'Deploying the application'
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        always {
            //
        }
    }
}
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216076050-21564a8a-7321-49cf-bdaa-c7079d02d924.png)

* `always`: Using an `always` condition within `post` means that section will always be executed no matter if the build was a success or failed.  This could be something like sending an email out to the team about the build, whether it failed or was a success.
* `success`: This block runs only if the build was successful.
* `failure`: This block runs only if the build failed.

To generalize, in the `post` block, you define expressions of either build status or build status change. So, for example, if the last build change failed and now it's green again, you can use that condition as well.

---

# Define Conditionals for Each Stage 

We can also define conditionals/expressions for each stage. To do this, we can add `when` expressions within the `stage` block ...  

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216079856-e48c3670-ebfc-4ad9-9938-07262486efcb.png)


The active branch name in the build is always available in `Jenkinsfile` through an environmental variable that Jenkins provides which is called `BRANCH_NAME`. Can also write it as `env.BRANCH_NAME`. You can use this to check what the current branch that is being built, is.

If we wanted to check if the active branch name is 'dev', we can use:

```
when {
                expression {
                        env.BRANCH_NAME == 'dev'
                }
            }
```

---

So, 

```
steps {
               echo 'Testing the application'
            }
            
```

will only run when the active branch is 'dev'. If the current branch is not dev, it will skip the `step` block within the `stage('Test')` block.

---


Can also use AND, OR expressions with Conditionals, so, for example, 

```
stage('Test') {
            when {
                expression {
                        env.BRANCH_NAME == 'dev' || env.BRANCH_NAME == 'master'
                }
            }

            steps {
               echo 'Testing the application'
            }
        }
```

The testing stage will only run if the current branch is 'dev' or 'master'.

---

Another situation where we can use `when` `expressions` is you only want to build your application if there are code changes made in the project. For example, in the 'build' stage, we can do:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216083948-4057078e-17e5-4235-86f7-231f0697268e.png)

Here, we are defining a variable called `CODE_CHANGES` outside of the pipeline.

`CODE_CHANGES = getGitChanges()` - this will be a groovy script that checks whether there has been any changes made in the code and sets the value of a Boolean, of `true` or `false`.

---

# Environmental Variables

By default, Jenkins provides so environmental variables, for example current branch name is `BRANCH_NAME`. 


There's some other stuff that you might need for the logic, for example, you want to know which build number the current build is so you can use it in your versioning.

To see the list of environmental variables, type `/env-vars.html/` to the end of the URL ... 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216088044-2c575d05-e511-49c9-b0d0-d0d48dee41d9.png)

`http://localhost:8080/env-vars.html/`

You can use these environmental variables in your Jenkinsfile. 

In addition to the ones that Jenkins provides, you can define your own environmental variables and this is also a common practice.

---

# Define Your Own Environmental Variables

In a Jenkinsfile there is an attribute called `environment`. Whatever environmental variables you define under `agent`, will be available for all the stages that you have in the pipeline. For example, below I have defined a variable `NEW_VERSION` which is equals to '1.3.0'.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216089434-e5edec2c-70fc-4e69-9500-98d570826719.png)

---

This is how we could use it in a stage:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216090629-4a8fa7ae-4ee2-4aec-92cb-12b5d0e33498.png)

---

Another practical example of using environmental variable can be credentials. 

For example, you have a stage that deploys your newly built application to a development server. And for that stage, you need credentials of the development server to connect to it and to copy the newly built artifact.

So, once you have defined credentials in Jenkins, you can use that in the `Jenkinsfile`.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216093316-f47be8ef-15cd-4a29-bb28-445c2b9c77d8.png)

Here, I have defined the `SERVER_CREDENTIALS` which equals to `credentials('')`. Here, we are extracting the credentials from Jenkins. The way this works is, `credentials()` is a function/method that binds the credentials that are defined in Jenkins to your environmental variable (in this case, `SERVER_CREDENTIALS`). 

To bind credentials to variables, need the `Credentials Binding` Plugin which makes it possible to use Jenkins credentials inside the Jenkinsfile.

`credentials()` as a parameter, it takes the ID or reference of the credentials in Jenkins. 

---

# Setting Credentials in Jenkins

To set the credentials in Jenkins ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216100949-4f710241-87f8-418a-9e7e-536338e71f1b.png)

Go to _Manage Jenkins_ > _Credentials_

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216101565-7deec2fe-af73-46ae-aa1e-c028dd0382a1.png)

Click on `global` at the bottom. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216102215-5e31354a-64d4-46b4-ab2a-9f1b5f3f34a9.png)

Then click on _Add Credentials_

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216102926-f08cec62-782a-4e14-bc7f-4d0c9ae55cac.png)

The kind for this example will be `Username with password`.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216102685-1c9ed8de-2c61-4ace-85ca-a118f17b13ed.png)

Add your username for the server and the password. `ID` is the reference for these credentials. Then click on `Create`.

We will now be able to reference these credentials in the Jenkinsfile via an environment variable using the `ID` (reference) we provided ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216103665-5f48b827-1ba7-4eb2-bf74-d4595e141b7d.png)

---

We can then use that environmental variable within a stage the same way as we did with `NEW_VERSION`. We have to enclose it in double quotes ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216104470-9d0b27c2-6191-4ff2-a07e-e2a2c60ee1ea.png)

```
pipeline {
    agent any
    environment {
        NEW_VERSION = '1.3.0'
        SERVER_CREDENTIALS = credentials('server_credentials')
    }

    stages {

        stage('Build') {
            steps {
               echo 'Building the application'
               echo "Building version ${NEW_VERSION}" 
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
               echo 'Testing the application'
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {

            steps {
               echo 'Deploying the application'
               sh "${SERVER_CREDENTIALS}"
            }
        }
    }

}
```

---


If you need your credentials only in one stage of the script, it actually makes sense to read them from Jenkins in that stage only. The way to do this is, instead of defining that in the `environment` block at the top (under `   agent any`), we can define it within the stage we want to use the credentials. For example, if we wanted to do this within the `Deploy`, the way we would do this is ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216111748-45ae895a-ea25-4684-adb9-4f5be8fa941c.png)

```
stage('Deploy') {

            steps {
               echo 'Deploying the application'
               withCredentials ([
                    usernamePassword(credentials: 'server_credentials', usernameVariable: USER, passwordVariable: PWD)
               ]) {
                    sh "some_script ${USER} ${PWD}"
               }
```
---

... use `withCredentials ([]) ` which takes an object as a parameter. That object in this case will be `usernamePassword()`.

`usernamePassword()` is a function that let's you get the username and password from the credentials individually. 

`usernamePassword(credentials: 'server_credentials')`: as a parameter, i  can pass in the ID of the credentials I set up in the Jenkins GUI which I named `server_credentials`.

---

The reason why I can use `usernamePassword()` function is because the type of credetial I created in the Jenkins GUI was of a type called Username with password ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216285683-206edad7-7be5-4e52-9ed4-ccb2bb193212.png)

---

After `usernamePassword(credentials: 'server_credentials',` I can add the username using `usernameVariable` and store it into a variable name of my choice, in this case, `USER`. To add the password, I can use `passwordVariable:` to add the password into a variable of my choice, in this case, `PWD`.

---

Now this means, within the next block `{}`, I can use the `USER` and `PWD` variables. 

`sh "some_script ${USER} ${PWD}"` - `some_script` will be come actual shell commands followed by the username and password. 

---

# Plugins Required to Use Credentials 

To use credentials this manner, we need to have 2 plugins installed. Go to _Manage Jenkins >_ _Manage Plugins_

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216295399-2ff5a731-c8db-4acd-b68d-ef73882654da.png)

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216296067-4dec65a0-aa1f-4a13-ab6f-f983cbf588d8.png)

The above 2 plugins is what we need. 

The `Credentials` plugin allows us to create credentials in the Jenkins UI, and the `Credentials Binding` plugin that allows us to use those credentials in the Jenkinsfile through environmental variables.

---

# Tool Attribute for Build Tools

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216297385-feae50af-ca90-4ebb-a02b-4afedaab001c.png)

Another useful thing that you can use in your Jenkinsfile is the `tools` attribute. `tools` provides you with build tools for your projects.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216297645-d247e2a5-fd9c-46af-8cb2-ab0df7f239b0.png)

For example, if you have a front-end and back-end application, you will have some build tools configured for that. It could be Maven, Gradle or some other tool. And when you're building an application, you want to have those tools available to you. 

---

For example, in build, you might use `mvn install`, such as: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216298457-244f0813-ba4e-46ff-9626-907507c56f9f.png)

To be able to do this, you need to have the tools available to you. One way to make them available is by using the `tools` attribute. 

> There are 3 tools that Jenkinsfile supports, they are Gradle, Maven and JDK.

The way to define which tool you want to use is by entering its name within the `tools` attribute block. 

---

After that, have to provide the name of the tool and that has to be pre-configured in Jenkins. The way to check that is by going to _Manage Jenkins > Global Tool Configuration_ ...

Scroll down to the tool and use the same `Name` within the Jenkinsfile, within quotes, in this case `MAVEN` like so ...

---

This will make available maven commands in all the stages within the Jenkinsfile.

# Parameters in Jenkinsfile 

Another thing that could also be helpful in pipelines is parameters. 

For example, you have some external configuration that you want to provide to your build to change some behaviour. An example could be that you have a build that deploys your application to a staging server and you want to be able to select which version of the application you want to deploy. To do this, you would define the selection within the parameters block ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216307110-3600c08c-104b-4543-be1f-e0863de95bfe.png)

# Parameter Type - string 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216306826-c567a46c-d2a4-4392-8ec1-9816c74c37d5.png)

* You add the `type` of the parameter, in this case, a `string`
* Then the name of the parameter (the way it will be displayed), in this case, we will call it `VERSION`
* Then the defaultValue using `defaultValue: ''`. This is empty in this case 
* Then the `description`. In this case, it will be `description: 'version to deploy on prod'`.

---

# Parameter Type - choice  

There are different types of parameters support for example, instead of `string` you can have a `choice`. So, instead of having to input a version name, you can have predefined choices of different versions that you can actually choose from.

---

Let's create a `choice` called `VERSION`.

* `choice(name: 'VERSION'`: here, we are declaring a type choice and naming it `VERSION`.
* `choices: ['1.1.0,', '1.2.0', '1.3.0']`: here we are adding the different versions
* `description: 'Versions available'`: here, we are adding a description

# Parameter Type - booleanParam

We have another type called `booleanParam`. An example of where we can use this is if you wanted to skip a certain stage on some builds.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216311845-32bef92e-c9c5-4ef7-879e-238868747061.png)

# Using parameters within a Jenkinsfile

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216314272-f9a0e6c7-b27e-4583-bcd9-eced744a383b.png)

So, now we've defined the parameters, we can now use these parameters in any of the stages within the Jenkinsfile.

Parameters can be used within  `when` `expression`s. For example, if the parameter `executeTests` is equal to `true`, only then are we going to run tests. If it is false, we will skip that step under the `with` `expression` ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216313710-d7b7cc63-709f-4163-8bb1-816303b567d6.png)

In the above example ...

 ```
 steps {
               echo 'Testing the application'
       }
```

will only run if `executeTests` is true. 

---

An example of using the `choice` type would be `echo "Deploying Version ${params.VERSIONS}"`

# Testing the Jenkinsfile 

Code so far is: 

```
pipeline {
    agent any
    parameters {
        string(name: 'VERSION', defaultValue: '', description: 'version to deploy on prod')
        choice(name: 'VERSIONS', choices: ['1.1.0,', '1.2.0', '1.3.0'], description: 'Versions available')
        booleanParam(name: 'executeTests',  defaultValue: true, decription: '')
    }
    

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
               echo 'Building the application'
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            when {
                expression {
                    params.executeTests == true
                }

            steps {
               echo 'Testing the application'
               }
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
               echo 'Deploying the application'
               echo "Deploying Version ${params.VERSIONS}"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Now will add the below code to the Jenkinsfile in the reposiotry ...

Let's see where I can view my parameters on Jenkins

---

Note, if you do not have the `Build with parameters`, you may have to download the below plugin ...

And then tick the `This project is parameterised` option ...

When trying to run the bild, it will ask which parameter wewant to run.

# Using External Groovy Script 

Another thing we can do in Jenkins is use external scripts. Normally, we have multipe stages within a Pipeline. Within each stage, logice tends to be used. The logic is mainly groovy scripts, and very quickly, your Jenkinsfile can get loaded with external scripts that execute different things. So, often, it's a good idea to clean up the Jenkinsfile and put all these scripts in its own file.

The way we can do this is to create a seperate groovy script. Up until now we have been using `echo` statements in our Jenkinsfile, but Jenkinsfile supports groovy script, so you can write much more powerful logic using groovy. 

So instaed of using `echo` statements, we can dfine a `script` block within a `steps` section ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216334935-ec3dfb70-9d44-4ccc-81d4-324d63b9dfd0.png)

Then, within the script block, we can write normal groovy code, such as define variables and functions.

For now, let's take these echo statements and extract them to a groovy script.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216357714-4fa1b162-09ee-4e6d-9832-9164462f85b5.png)

The above is a groovy script which defines a function that outputs the statement: `Building the application`.

`return this` is important as this allows the Jenkinsfile to import this. 

So, now the question is, how do we import this groovy function in the Jenkinsfile? 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216355413-dd7a2143-05da-461f-b283-24427f8da357.png)

To do this, will create another stage at the top, called `init` and create a `script` block (because it will have a groovy commmand) which loads the groovy script. 

---

Now, I want to make this a variable, `gv`, that holds the imported groovy script globally available so that I can use it in all my stages. To do this, we need to define the variable `gv` on top of `pipleline` ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216357976-44f18f47-ed22-4c32-9c91-98916a3813a9.png)

Here, we are using `def gv` to make `gv` globally available and ... 

```
stage('init') {
          script {
            gv = load "script.groovy"
          }
        }
```
        
... is being used to load the script from groovy so that now I can use it in any stage of the script. For example: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216358694-31705cb7-355f-4d05-90d9-07c049117bec.png)

if we wanted to run the `buildApp` groovy function in the `build` stage, wefirst need to get rid of the echo statement and replace it with a `script` block, so it should look like: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/216359256-60e26c6d-43a6-417d-8ade-c9c745f12904.png)

`gv.buildApp`: `gv` is the variable name we have used to load the groovy script from the `script.groovy` file and `buildApp` is the function we want to use from `script.groovy`.
