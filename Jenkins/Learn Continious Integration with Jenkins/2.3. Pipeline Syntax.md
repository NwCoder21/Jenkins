# What is Jenkinsfile?

Normally, in Jenkins, we would create new jobs and configure them. However, instead of creating and configuring jobs using the Jenkins User Interface, Jenkinsfile allows us to write a file (in other words, script a build and its configuration in a file) named `Jenkinsfile`.

* Jenkinsfile is Pipeline as a Code (a scripted pipeline). 
* The Jenkinsfile is created in your repository.

The first step is to create a Jenkinsfile in your repository. Call it `Jenkinsfile`.

```jenkinsfile
pipeline {

    agent any

    stages {

        stage('Build') {

            steps {
               
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The above is a boilerplate for a Jenkisfile.

A Jenkinsfile can be written as a Scripted Pipeline or a Declarative Pipeline. 

The Scripted Pipeline was the first syntax of `Jenkinsfile`. It allows you to write the whole configuration of the Jenkinsfile using groovy script.

This means the only structure that you have in a Scripted Pipeline is the above screenshot and inside of it you have groovy scripts and you can write the whole configuration here in a flexible manner as you wish so there is no predefined structure. However, for
people who know groovy syntax or who havent' worked with groovy, it can be a  little difficult to start with.
