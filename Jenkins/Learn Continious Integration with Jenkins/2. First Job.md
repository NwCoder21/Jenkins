# First Job   


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215497611-619a3bde-43f7-4a00-912b-ce1ff5fbccfe.png)

There are two typs of Jenkins jobs, Freestyle and Pipeline as a Code.

Job means wrkload that Jenkins runs for you. For example, in bash scripting, we write a script to accomplish or automate a task. Likewise, in Jenkins, we create jobs.

Let's compare these two jobs, Freestyle versus Pipeline as a Code.

---

### Freestyle Jobs

Freestyle job are all graphical jobs. So you click on create a job and you fill in all the information. It's like filling in a form. you then run the job and see the output. The issue with this is, to create one pipeline, you will need to create multiple jobs, such as: 

* Fetch the code job
* Build the code job
* Run the code job  
* Test the code job
* Deploy the code job

This means a lot of form filling to create one pipeline. Also, if you want to o the same thing for another project, then you will need to do a lot of form filling which takes up time.

Can use a Freestylejob for learning and understanding purpose of a pipeline, explore Jenkins and understand the basic concepts but it is not recommended for everyday use. 

Because nowadays, we need everything as code. Even the pipeline should be created through a code and Jenkins allows us to do that. This is called Pipline as a Code. 

---

### Pipline as a Code

So you create a similar or same pipeline, which will be written in the Groovy Language. So it's similar to creating a Freestyle job, where you create a job, but in that job, you mention the entire script and that entire script is your pipeline. And you can version control it because it will be all text.

---

# Set Up

Before we run our job, before we create and run our job, we need to make sure we have JDK 8 and Maven.

To do that, go to _Manage_ Jenkins

---

_Global Tool Configuration._. From here we can configure the tools that Jenkins will use. Once clicked, scroll down and you will   see ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215505960-6f47e25c-02cb-4d61-a8cf-0562d93595c9.png)

And ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215506035-ee2450bb-bd22-4c76-9cb2-3d92fd34e5fb.png)

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215507850-63d67113-32b9-4dda-8501-c9c147d29c40.png)

First click on _Add JDK_. Add a `Name`. This can be anything but you will need to remember it. Uncheck the `install automatically` box as we will install a JDK 8 from the command line and then specify its path under `JAVA_HOME`. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215509850-54dd7527-50f2-4707-bf4d-0964e4e3a33b.png)

So we already have JDK 11 in this Jenkins. For our project, we need JDK eight. So installing JDK 8, so, you now have to JDK 11 in Jenkins, and JDK eight.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215510245-608a7743-fbb7-43d8-ba0c-445b864c426a.png)

If you run the command `java -version`, you will that Java 11 being used, and that is fine as Jenkins runs on that.

---

So how do we specfy JDK 8 on the _Global Tool Configuration_ page? Run `ls /usr/lib/jvm` in the command line and we will see ..

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215511596-29a7d924-1488-426b-8635-ca1c1e5b33ca.png)

we need to do is specify this path, `/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64` in the `JAVE_HOME` section in Jenkins, like so: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215512350-65b1b2f6-514e-40c4-90fc-308bb91d95d9.png)

So specifying that this is the Java home directory that you need to use.

Also, make sure you remember the `NAME` you have given here, or you can come back and check the name, so you can specify the correct name of the tool that you're using in your code.

---

Then scroll down to the Maven section ...

Click on `Add Maven`. Provide a `NAME` and choose the version you have installed and then click on `_Save_`.

The go back to your main _Dashboard_.

---

Next, we will see how to create a job and use the tools that we just added.

---

# First Job 

Now it's time to create our first job.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215515873-2aa45a49-fcc3-4725-ae55-1da9d4b70ab5.png)
 
Click on _New Item_ or _Create a Job_ to start.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215516191-299ca6e0-e971-4610-aac8-574f5ba31b83.png)

Give your job a name. For our first job, we will selecting the _Freestyle project_ option and then click on _OK_. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215516898-b6727ed7-c1f4-40ae-b37d-74bfb6af8e15.png)

This will open up a page where we can fill in the configuration of this job. For the description, I'll type `vprofile maven build project`.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215517717-987dd051-8efd-4bda-9c93-999156319749.png)

For `Source Code Management`, we have 2 choices, `None` or `Git` but if you have other version control plugins installed, you can see their options as well.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215518323-90139d33-e438-4724-8119-9ea54236eeb6.png)

For this project, we will be using a Git [repository](https://github.com/devopshydclub/vprofile-project). To get the Repository URL link ...

Click on _Code_ and ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215522070-42c78548-b3eb-4fb5-b245-bb59b485f6fd.png)

copy the HTTPS link.

This is a public repository, so you don't need to mention any credentials, but if it was a a private repository, you would need to mention the credentials.

You can save your credentials and use later on if you want to. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215524278-bd90fdd6-774d-4a5f-a775-6fefe1fcc63d.png)

You need to mention the branch. Fir this build, will  mention the branch `vp-rem`, not the master one. The `vp-rem` branch does  exist over on GitHub ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215523603-02a5dc17-dccd-44b6-9e68-2f88e1a14966.png)

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215525175-6fc1f046-0143-4935-845f-da87b2b93a75.png)

If we then scroll down, we will see some options for `Build Triggers`. That means how this job will run. Will explore these options later on.

For now, we'll be manually triggering/starting this job.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215526332-915ef1c4-7d5b-45b0-a9bd-7960db82e35c.png)

Then we have some `Build Environment` options. We'll leave these for now.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215526555-c00596cc-b72c-4bf8-84f8-69a4b5962985.png)

Then we have the `Build Steps` section. This is important. Click on `Add buld step` to th=see the various options. 

`Execute Windows bash command`: if you are running Jenkins on a Windows machine, you can execute Windows Command.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215528170-08a6e86c-0cb9-4137-a9e5-7933973829b9.png)

For example, if we choose Execute shell, we can run this command to install Maven. 

---

But if you really want to execute Maven, there is a better option and that is ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215528670-27f36d00-1399-4851-a1da-1c0c19b20330.png)

`Invoke top-level Maven targets`. So if you already have a setting or if you have a plugin in Jenkins that you can use, you should use that instead of running commands as it is easier to configure. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215529034-cfb0c5a9-148a-407a-a7c7-67c0c9964556.png)

This is because we can then select the Maven version. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215529280-513cbc03-eec8-4f6b-889b-b5fd81a93b8b.png)

Then add  a goal. You can then also look into the _Advanced_ options ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215529430-4b1d5355-4336-45a9-93b3-d115a50aab3b.png)

you can mention a different `POM XML` file, you can mention some properties, JVM options, different settings file, so many configuration changes you can do over here while you're running the build job. f you need to do that same from a shell command, you can but will be way too complicated.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215530105-34592f8c-1a03-4b81-b763-84dac4203c8b.png)

Then we have some `Post-build Actions` which we will leave for now. Then click on `Save`.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215531448-4cd9ec67-1f6a-4677-b957-59331ecaf125.png)

Our job contains two things. Fetch the source code and run, even install.

Click on the _Dashboard_ button to go to the main page ...

Here you can click on your job to go into it ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215532042-927acf49-ba5d-4edc-ba10-269e954e92ab.png)

Here we have few options. One option is for`Workspace`. This is the directory that this job will use to hold all the data build.

`Build Now` which will trigger/start the job. 

`Configure`: if you want to make changes, you can click on configure and make the changes.

`Delete`: delete the project.

`Rename`: rename the project.
