There are two typs of Jenkins jobs, Freestyle and Pipeline as a Code.

Job means wrkload that Jenkins runs for you. For example, in bash scripting, we write a script to accomplish or automate a task. Likewise, in Jenkins, we create jobs.

Let's compare these two jobs, Freestyle versus Pipeline as a Code.

---

### Freestyle Jobs

Freestyle job are all graphical jobs. So you click on create a job and you fill in all the information. It's like filling in a form. you then run the job and see the output. The issue with this is, to create one pipeline, you will need to create multiple jobs, such as: 

* Fetch the code job
* Build the code job
* Run the code job  
* Test the code job
* Deploy the code job

This means a lot of form filling to create one pipeline. Also, if you want to o the same thing for another project, then you will need to do a lot of form filling which takes up time.

Can use a Freestylejob for learning and understanding purpose of a pipeline, explore Jenkins and understand the basic concepts but it is not recommended for everyday use. 

Because nowadays, we need everything as code. Even the pipeline should be created through a code and Jenkins allows us to do that. This is called Pipline as a Code. 

---

### Pipline as a Code

So you create a similar or same pipeline, which will be written in the Groovy Language. So it's similar to creating a Freestyle job, where you create a job, but in that job, you mention the entire script and that entire script is your pipeline. And you can version control it because it will be all text.

# Set Up

Before we run our job, before we create and run our job, we need to make sure we have JDK 8 and Maven.

To do that, go to _Manage_ Jenkins

_Global Tool Configuration._. From here we can configure the tools that Jenkins will use. Once clicked, scroll down and you will   see ...

And ...

First click on _Add JDK_. Add a `Name`. This can be anything but you will need to remember it. Uncheck the `install automatically` box as we will install a JDK 8 from the command line and then specify its path under `JAVA_HOME`.

So we already have JDK 11 in this Jenkins. For our project, we need JDK eight. So installing JDK 8, so, you now have to JDK 11 in Jenkins, and JDK eight.

If you run the command `java -version`, you will that Java 11 being used, and that is fine as Jenkins runs on that.

---

So how do we specfy JDK 8 on the _Global Tool Configuration_ page? Run `ls /usr/lib/jvm` in the command line and we will see ..

we need to do is specify this path, `/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64` in the `JAVE_HOME` section in Jenkins, lie so: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215512350-65b1b2f6-514e-40c4-90fc-308bb91d95d9.png)

So specifying that this is the Java home directory that you need to use.

Also, make sure you remember the `NAME` you have given here, or you can come back and check the name, so you can specify the correct name of the tool that you're using in your code.

---

Then scroll down to the Maven section ...

Click on `Add Maven`. Provide a `NAME` and choose the version you have installed and then click on `_Save_`.

The go back to your main _Dashboard_.

Next, we will see how to create a job and use the tools that we just added.

# First Job 

Now it's time to create our first job.
