There are two typs of Jenkins jobs, Freestyle and Pipeline as a Code.

Job means wrkload that Jenkins runs for you. For example, in bash scripting, we write a script to accomplish or automate a task. Likewise, in Jenkins, we create jobs.

Let's compare these two jobs, Freestyle versus Pipeline as a Code.

### Freestyle Jobs

Freestyle job are all graphical jobs. So you click on create a job and you fill in all the information. It's like filling in a form. you then run the job and see the output. The issue with this is, to create one pipeline, you will need to create multiple jobs, such as: 

* Fetch the code job
* Build the code job
* Run the code job  
* Test the code job
* Deploy the code job

This means a lot of form filling to create one pipeline. Also, if you want to o the same thing for another project, then you will need to do a lot of form filling which takes up time.

Can use a Freestylejob for learning and understanding purpose of a pipeline, explore Jenkins and understand the basic concepts but it is not recommended for everyday use. 

Because nowadays, we need everything as code. Even the pipeline should be created through a code and Jenkins allows us to do that. This is called Pipline as a Code.

### Pipline as a Code

So you create a similar or same pipeline, which will be written in the Groovy Language. So it's similar to creating a Freestyle job, where you create a job, but in that job, you mention the entire script and that entire script is your pipeline. And you can version control it because it will be all text.
