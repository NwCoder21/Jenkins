Why do we need Continious Integration? 

The main reason why we should be implementing continuous integration, continuous delivery, continuous deployment is to get quick feedback.

Whenever you commit some code into your GitHub repository or any version control system that you are using, you'd want to: 

* Immediately run your unit test. 
* You would also want to check the quiloty of the code. 
* You'd want to be able to see if you're able to package your application well.
* You'd want be able to run your integration test and see if any issues arise from that.

You don't want to find this out a few days after the code is committed.

This is why continuous integration is really helpful. You will find problems early and get immediate feedback.
