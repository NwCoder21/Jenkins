# Getting Started with Continuous Integration, Deployment and Delivery

Why do we need Continious Integration? 

The main reason why we should be implementing continuous integration, continuous delivery, continuous deployment is to get quick feedback.

Whenever you commit some code into your GitHub repository or any version control system that you are using, you'd want to: 

* Immediately run your unit test. 
* You would also want to check the quiloty of the code. 
* You'd want to be able to see if you're able to package your application well.
* You'd want be able to run your integration test and see if any issues arise from that.

You don't want to find this out a few days after the code is committed.

This is why continuous integration is really helpful. You will find problems early and get immediate feedback.

1. In a typical continuous integration cycle what you would:

* Commit of code
* Run the unit test
* Run your code quality checks
* Packaging
* Run the integration test.

2. In the continuous deployment, you take an additional step. You will deploy the package into an environment such as a QA or Dev enviroment. And in addition to this, might also run a few more automated tests

---

3. Continuous delivery takes this another step further. Along with packaging and deploying and running your automated tests, you'd set up a pipeline in such a way that you'd be able to, with a few manual approvals, deploy the code out to production. 

In other words, as soon as you commit some code in your Git repository, all the steps would be run, and if the testing/QA team are ready and they do the manual approvals, the code would be immediately deployed onto the production environment.

# What are the popular tools to implement Continuous Integration, Continuous Development and Continuous Delivery?

The most popular tools are Jenkins and Azure DevOps. So, how do you implement continuous integration, continuous delivery, continuous deployment using Azure DevOps or Jenkins? You would create something called pipelines. Pipelines have a number of steps, for example,

Each step in the above screenshot is a step in a pipeline.
