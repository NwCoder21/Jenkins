Click on `New Item`.

Give the job a name and select `Pipeline` and then select `OK`.

Scroll down to the `Pipeline` section ...

And then add below template: 

```
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Example') {
            steps {
                
            }
        }
    }
```

---

In `stage('Example')`, we can replace `Example` with anything relevant, maybe something like `Git`.

---

The part where it says `echo 'Hello World'`, this is where our code will go. If not sure what to write, click on the `PipeLine Syntax` option.

---

Because we want to try and clone a Git repository, select the `git: Git` option from the drop-down list. 

---

Then provide the URL for the Git repository you want to clone. To do this, go to the Git repository you want to clone nd copy its address ...

and paste into the `URL` section on Jenkins ...

---

Then choose which branch you want to clone the repository from. In this case, I'm using the Master branch.

---

For `Credentials`, it is asking if you need any credentials to clone this repository. If this repository was public, these details would not be required. However, in this case, this repository is private, so will need to provide credentials. So now I will add my credentials so click on `Add` ...

Then add your GitHub Userbane amd Password.

For `ID` and Description, I can type anything, in this case, i'll enter git_credentials for both.

---

Then click on `ADD`.

---

Then click on `Generate Pipeline Script`. Copy the code generated and replace `echo 'Hello World'` in the pipleine script with it.

```
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Git') {
            steps {
                git credentialsId: 'git_credentials1', url: 'https://github.com/NwTestuser/jenkins-devops-microservice.git'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

---

If the repository was public, all we would need to add is `git url: 'https://github.com/NwTestuser/jenkins-devops-microservice.git`.

Because the repository is private, we need to add the `credentialsId: 'git_credentials1'` too.

---

# Side Note - Adding Branch Details 

If you did not want to clone from the master branch, instead another brach, we would use:

```yaml
branch: '<name_of_branch'
```

In that case, it would become 

```yaml
git branch:'dev', credentialsId: 'git_credentials1', url: 'https://github.com/NwTestuser/jenkins-devops-microservice.git', 
```

To do this, we would have written the branch name, for example `dev`, under the section `Branch` after clicking the the `PipeLine Syntax` option. Then when we clicked on `Generate Pipeline Script` it would have been added to the script.

If the branch is Master, do'nt need to provide branch details in the actual script.

Coming back to the script, click on `Apply` and then `Save`. Then click on `Build Now` 

--- 

The build failed.

Checked to see why this is and found out that the branch name on GitHub is main ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215766322-ac2d3099-2d47-424a-9768-6915e1c1d5f5.png)

So changed the name of the branch to main ... 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215766488-05ee2b3f-7284-4745-861b-0efbef9203e5.png)

This generated 

```
git branch: 'main', credentialsId: 'git_credentials1', url: 'https://github.com/NwTestuser/jenkins-devops-microservice.git'
```
I then added this to the Pipeline script ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215766718-c9fba6f6-2597-4dd7-85de-baf03656c258.png)

```
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Git') {
            steps {
                git branch: 'main', credentialsId: 'git_credentials1', url: 'https://github.com/NwTestuser/jenkins-devops-microservice.git'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

---

I then clicked on `Build Now` ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215767001-72fbfe40-4ff5-40b4-9b0d-02fd10fe5bc4.png)

Now the job was a success.
