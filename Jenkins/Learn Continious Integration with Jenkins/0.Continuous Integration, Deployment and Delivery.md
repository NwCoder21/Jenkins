# Getting Started with Continuous Integration, Deployment and Delivery

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215051034-5da5e3cb-6009-4184-a1ca-f0435ac47c68.png)

Why do we need Continuous Integration? 

The main reason why we should be implementing continuous integration, continuous delivery, continuous deployment is to get quick feedback.

Whenever you commit some code into your GitHub repository or any version control system that you are using, you'd want to: 

* Immediately run your unit test. 
* You would also want to check the quality of the code. 
* You'd want to be able to see if you're able to package your application well.
* You'd want be able to run your integration test and see if any issues arise from that.

You don't want to find this out a few days after the code is committed.

This is why continuous integration is really helpful. You will find problems early and get immediate feedback.

# Difference Between Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment, and Continuous Delivery?

1. In a typical continuous integration cycle what you would:

* Commit of code
* Run the unit test
* Run your code quality checks
* Packaging
* Run the integration test.

---

2. In the continuous deployment, you take an additional step. You will deploy the package into an environment such as a QA or Dev environment. And in addition to this, might also run a few more automated tests.

---

3. Continuous delivery takes this another step further. Along with packaging and deploying and running your automated tests, you'd set up a pipeline in such a way that you'd be able to, with a few manual approvals, deploy the code out to production. 

In other words, as soon as you commit some code in your Git repository, all the steps would be run, and if the testing/QA team are ready and they do the manual approvals, the code would be immediately deployed onto the production environment.

---

# What are the popular tools to implement Continuous Integration, Continuous Development and Continuous Delivery?

The most popular tools are Jenkins and Azure DevOps. So, how do you implement continuous integration, continuous delivery, continuous deployment using Azure DevOps or Jenkins? You would create something called pipelines. Pipelines have a number of steps, for example, 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215055593-012db0b6-4764-48cd-964a-04da282bd755.png)

Each of the stages in the above screenshot is a step in a pipeline. So, we create create continuous integration pipelines or continuous delivery pipelines or continuous deployment pipelines.

# Deeper Dive into the Above Steps

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215063320-5a940163-8137-47ca-b1d1-4ca83c835493.png)

Let's take a closer look at each of the above steps:

* **Code Commit**: is normally done in a version control system. The most popular version control system today is Git Or GitHub or maybe even your own private Git repository.
* **Unit Tests**: are typically used to test your methods and classes. If you're using Java, **_JUnit_** is one of the most popular unit testing frameworks.
* **Integration Tests**: here, we would write automated tests for a few modules integrated together. This is where frameworks like Cucumber, Selenium, Protractor are used. 
* **Package**: where you would actually build a deployable unit for your application. The typical tools which are used at this stage are npm for JavaScript, pip for Python, and Maven or Gradle for Java.
* **Deploy**: once you have the application package ready, you can easily deploy it to any of your environments, either using Jenkins or Azure DevOps.
* **Automated Tests**: Once you deploy your code to an environment, you can run additional automated tests. Tests such as: 
  * Load tests
  * Performance tests
  * Smoke tests
*  Testing Approval: once the above is complete, you can implement manual approvals to deploy code into a specific environment.
*  **Deploy NEXT**: once your automated tests run fine and your manual tests are also fine, you can go ahead and approve and the code which would then be deployed automatically to the next environment. So, for example, If you are approving the testing from a QA stage, the code would probably be deployed to something like a staging environment.

---

To summarise, continuous integration, continuous deployment, and continuous delivery enable us to get quick feedback. The other thing these enable is automatic deployment of your code packages to different environments.

# What is Jenkins and How it Improves Your DevOps Continuous Environment 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215434107-62c89678-3c9e-465d-9c28-3c4415ba1a20.png)

This is what we will cover in this section. We'll look at:

* What life is like before using Jenkins 
* The issues that Jenkins specifically addresses
* What is Jenkins and how it applies to continuous integration and the other continuous integration tools that you need in your DevOps team
* Features of Jenkins
* Jenkins architecture

# Life before Jenkins 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215435074-3a39943e-a0c1-4026-9470-418138620690.png)

Before Jenkins, developers would write code and run unit tests, and then submit it into a code repository. Issue with this is that commits which get sent to the code repository are not consistent. Developers could be based in different countries which means they could be working at different times and they have different amounts of code going into the code repository.

This can cause issues with the integration and delays in testing the code, which in turn means, more bugs arising in the code. This will delay the project even further.

---

In the past, they would have to wait until the entire software code was built and tested before we could even begin checking for errors. This method meant that developers had to check the entire source code to find errors which them meant finding and fixing bugs became even more difficult.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215437107-f892d83c-11fd-4776-a52a-7727f920a325.png)

The process of delivering software was slow and there was no way that you could iterate on your software, and you ended up with a situation where teams would point fingers at each other and blame each other for the delays.

---

# What is Jenkins

Now let's look at Jenkins and how it can address these problems. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215437721-c33f2f72-b2ac-41e2-8c95-d561d2ba4e27.png)

Jenkins allows developers to continuously develop AND test their code and then move on to new sections of code. Jenkins is a product that allows you to expand on that capacity to your entire team so now you're able to submit your codes consistently into a source code environment. 

There are two ways you can do continuous delivery. One is nightly builds, and the other is continuously. 

In the past developers would perform nightly builds. The way this would work is code developers would have a cut-off time at the end of the day which was consistent around the world. They would have to put their code into a single repository and, at night, that all of that code would be run, operated and tested to see if there were any new changes.. If there were, a new built would be created. This is what is referred to as the nightly build.

---

With continuous integration we're able to go one step further. Not only can we commit our changes into our source code, but we can also do this continuously which means no-one is rushed to commit their code before a cut-off time in the day. 

With continuous integration, we are able to do a continuous release because what you're doing is, you're putting your tests and your verification services into the build environment so you're always running cycles to test against your code.

This is the advantage Jenkins gives using continuous integration.

# What is Continuous Integration

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215448981-89280ea4-efe2-435a-b691-a5615ac16306.png)

The concept of continuous integration is that a developer is able to pull from a repository the code that they are working on and then, at anytime, be able to submit the code they are working on continuous integration server. The purpose of that continuous integration server is to validate the code by running it through a test which  a tester may have created. 

If on the continuous integration server a test isn't passed, then that code gets sent back to the developer and the developer can then make the changes needed to fix the code. This is helpful as it prevents the developer not to break the code and it means the developer does not have to run all the tests locally on their machine. This saves the developer time.  

This also means if there are any errors which are a bit more complex, those errors can be passed from the tester to the developer easily. 

---

The goal from doing all this testing is that you're able to release and deploy the code faster to the customer/end-user, and also when they do get that code, it works.

---

Jenkins has now become an open source project. It is one of the most popular and continuously contributed projects that's available as open source which means you're always getting new features being added to it. It's a tool that really becomes the center for the CI environment.

# Features of Jenkins

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215452200-c5c313e5-45a4-4c3c-820a-bfd5e42f2b22.png)

Jenkins itself is really comprised of five key areas:

* Easy installation: Jenkins is a self-contained Java program. This means it can be run on most operating systems such as Windows, MAC and Linux. 
* Easy configuration: can be easily set up and configured via its web interface which includes error checks and built-in help.
* Plugins: one of the reasons why Jenkins is very powerful and useful for developers and DevOps teams is that Jenkins has so many plugins that extend the base functionality of it. Jenkins has 100's of plugins in the Update Center and integrates with every tool in the CI and CD toolchain. 
* Extensible: Jenkins is also extremely extensible. Jenkins can be extended via its plugins architecture and provides many opportunities. 
* Distribution: Jenkins is really easy to have available across your entire network, in other words, it can easily distribute work across multiple machines, helping in faster builds, tests and deployments across multiple platforms.

 # Jenkins Pipeline 
 
 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215454220-88cfd861-169a-41a4-a1da-d84577e62baa.png)

Now let's look at the standard Jenkins pipeline.  
 
**Code Commit**: When you are doing development, you start to first write the code on your machine. When you are using a Jenkins pipeline, you then commit your code.

If a developer was not using Jenkins, they would submit their code to a Git server, or another SCM server. If they are using a Jenkins pipeline, the developer will submit their code into Jenkins. 

**Build and Test**: Jenkins will then build your code. and part of that build process is actually going through and running tests. A developer will also do their own tests before submitting, tests such as unit and validation tests but there may be additional tests that Jenkins is running. For example, as a team you may have a standard set of tests for how you actually write out your code so that each team member can understand the code that's been written. These tests can also be included in the testing process within the jenkins environment. 
 
**Release**: If everything passes the tests, everything will get placed in the stage and release-ready environment within Jenkins.

**Deploy/Deliver**: from the stage and release-ready environment, everything is placed in the Deploy/Deliver environment. Jenkins is the tool which will help you with your server environment to be able to deploy your code to the production environment.

The result is that you're able to move from a developer to production code really quickly. This whole process can be automated rather than having to wait for people to actually test developers' codes or have to wait for the nightly build. Rather, we are able to commit your code and go through this testing process and release process continuously

# Jenkins Architecture 

Now let's talk about the architecture within Jenkins that allows you to be so effective at applying a continuous delivery DevOps environment.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215473629-c6a9b211-4173-4578-ac8e-6a18e860b73d.png)

**CI Server**: The server architecture is broken up into two sections. On the left hand side section you have the code the developers are writing and submitting that code to a source code repository. From there, Jenkins is your continuous integration server and it will then pull any code that's been sent to the source code repository and will run tests against.

> Jenkins server checks the repository at regular intervals and pulls any newly available code. 

**Build Server**: It will then use a build server such as maven to actually then build the code and at every single stage that we have that Jenkins manages there are constant tests. So, if a build fails, feedback is sent to the developers so that they can then change their code so that the build environment can run effectively.

> Build server builds the code into an executable file. Here, Java file is being converted into a JAR file. In case the build fails, the feedback is sent to the developers.  


**Test Server**: the final stage is to actually execute specific test scripts and these test groups can be written in selenium. 

Note: both mavin and selenium are plugins that run in the Jenkins environment. Mavin and Selenium are just two very popular examples of how you can extend the Jenkins environment 

> Jenkins then deploys the build application on to a test server for testing. If the test fails, feedback is sent to the developers.

**Production Server**: Remember, the goal to go through this whole process is to create an automated process that gets your code from the developer to the production server as quickly as possible whilst it being fully tested and having no errors.

> If there are no errors on the Test Server, the tested application is then deployed onto the production server.

Note: if you have different code builds that need to be managed and distributed, this will require that you need to have multiple builds being managed. Jenkins doesn't allow for multiple files and builds to be executed on a single server. 

> A single Jenkins server cannot handle multiple files and builds. We will need distributed Jenkins architecture to overcome this issue.

# Master Slave Architecture Within Jenkins

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215494150-d27a2024-5d5a-4dbd-ba62-1da44b406ee3.png)

The above is an overview of the master slave architecture within Jenkins.

On the left side we have a remote source code repository which can be GitHub, or the new Azure DevOps code repository, or it could be your own git repository.

The Jenkins server acts as the master environment on the left hand side and that master environment can then push out to multiple other Jenkins slave environments to distribute the workload.

This means it allows you to run multiple builds and tests and production environments simultaneously across your entire architecture. So Jenkins slaves can be running the different build versions of the code for different operating systems and the server master is controlling how each of those builds operate.
