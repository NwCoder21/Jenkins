# 2.2 - Some Simple Jenkins Jobs - Build a Maven Project Using Declarative Pipeline

Note: for this project/job, I will be cloning the above repository using the steps in the [previous lesson](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Jenkins/blob/main/Jenkins/Learn%20Continious%20Integration%20with%20Jenkins/2.1.%20Some%20Simple%20jenkins%20Jobs%20-%20How%20to%20Clone%20A%20GitHub%20Repository%20-%20How%20to%20Clone%20A%20GitHub%20Repository.md). I will call this project/job `Clone A GitHub Repository V2`. Because it is a public repository, it does not need credentials. 

> See below for the changes I made to clone the above repository ...

The above three screenshots show the changes I made to clone the above repository and the results when I ran the build.

To check the Maven name, go to `Manage Jenkins` > `Global Tool Configuration` and scroll down to the `MAVEN` section ...

We can see the name for our Maven is `MAVEN`.

We are going to build upon the last job we created. So, click on `Configure`.

---

Scroll down to the `Pipeline` section. We are going to add another `stage` to the script.

> Remember: every `stage` sits under `stages`. This is how you add additional stages to a Jenkins Pipeline

```
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Cloning a Git Repository!') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/ravdy/hello-world.git'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Build the Git repository!') {
            steps {
                sh "mvn clean install"
            }
         }
    }
}
```

I have named the second stage `Build the Git Repository!`.

---

Then click on `Apply` and then `Save`. Then build the job by clicking on `Build Now`

From the below screenshot we can see where this has been downloaded to:

If we go to the machine terminal, we will be able to see the application.

# Side Note

If you run the build and see an error which says 'mvn: command not found, this means we have not told Jenkins where Maven is available. To find where it is, run `whereis mvn` in the terminal ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215799050-15e4c075-cab8-444d-b7a4-c49a1addc678.png)

and copy that path and add it as a path to the script on the `Configure` page. This is where will use `environment`.

---

Within `environment`, we need to specify the path to maven.

```
environment {
        PATH = "/usr/bin/mvn:$PATH"
    }
```

This updates the path with the new information. So, when it runs `mvn clean install`, it knows now to look in `/usr/bin/mvn` for that command. 

> Remember: if we specify environment under `pipeline`, it will be available for every stage. However, if we specify `environment` under a particular `stage`, it will only be available for that particular `stage`.

```jenkins
pipeline {
    agent any
    environment {
        PATH = "/usr/bin/mvn:$PATH"
    }
    stages {
        stage('Cloning a Git Repository!') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/ravdy/hello-world.git'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Build the Git Repository!') {
            steps {
                sh "mvn clean install"
            }
         }
    }
}
```
