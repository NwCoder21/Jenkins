### Installing Jenkins

```
# Import the GPG key for Jenkins repo
wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key \
| sudo apt-key add -
# Add the repo to the list of sources
sudo sh -c 'echo deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > \
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
#Update package index
sudo apt-get update
#Install Jenkins
sudo apt-get install jenkins 
```

Now we will install Jenkins by following the below steps. Use:

```
wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key \
| sudo apt-key add -
```

Then:

```
sudo sh -c 'echo deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > \
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
```

Then run `sudo apt update` to install required packages

---

Now install Jenkins using:

```
sudo apt-get install jenkins
```

You can start, stop, and check the status of Jenkins by running the systemctl command:

```
systemctl start|stop|status jenkins
```

To check if it is running, use

```
sudo systemctl status jenkins
```

We can see it is now running.

To see the initial password, copy `/var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword` and run 

```
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```

in the terminal. This will show you the password. Then paste the password into the interface.

git remote add origin git@github.com:NwCoder21/jenkins-devops-microservice.git
git push -u origin main
```

### …or push an existing repository from the command line

```
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:NwCoder21/jenkins-devops-microservice.git
git push -u origin main

We obviously committing the code into the GitHub repository which we have just created, and if you do a refresh on the GitHub repository, cool, the GitHub repository is now ready for use.
