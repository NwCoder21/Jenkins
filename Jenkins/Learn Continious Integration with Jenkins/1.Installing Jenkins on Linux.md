To install git, use:

```
sudo apt install git
```

To confirm git has been installed, use:

```
git --version
```

---

### Installing Maven

Java is a prerequisite for installing Maven. To install Maven, use:

```
sudo apt install maven
```

To check if Maven has been installed, use:

```
mvn -version
```

### Installing Jenkins

```
# Import the GPG key for Jenkins repo
wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key \
| sudo apt-key add -
# Add the repo to the list of sources
sudo sh -c 'echo deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > \
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
#Update package index
sudo apt-get update
#Install Jenkins
sudo apt-get install jenkins 
```

Now we will install Jenkins by following the below steps. Use:

```
wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key \
| sudo apt-key add -
```

Then:

```
sudo sh -c 'echo deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > \
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
```

Then run `sudo apt update` to install required packages

---

Now install Jenkins using:

```
sudo apt-get install jenkins
```

---

You can start, stop, and check the status of Jenkins by running the systemctl command:

```
systemctl start|stop|status jenkins
```

To check if it is running, use

```
sudo systemctl status jenkins
```

We can see it is now running. 

---

Then go to browser and type `localhost:8080`.

```
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```

in the terminal. This will show you the password. Then paste the password into the interface.

Before you can start using Jenkins, you will need to install plugins. On this screen, you have to select one of the two options:

* Install suggested plugins This will install the recommended set of plugins, a set based on the most common use cases. We recommend that you select this option as this will quickly get you started with Jenkins.
* Select plugins to install. You will be required to select specific plugins based on your preference.

# Linking Git account to GitHub Account

[Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent - Linux](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent?platform=linux)

The above is the link for the documentation and steps needed to link Git and GitHub using a SSH key.

First run the command:

```yaml
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

Then pressed enter at the above yellow stages. 

---

Next step is to then add the SSH key to the SSH agent.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215184654-9de502c2-1566-462c-bb3c-f0953cd0f8fc.png)

To do this, I ran:

```
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

---

Then I ran:

```
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

followed by the passphrase I entered above. 

---


# So now the final step is to go to GitHub and add that SSH key to the GitHub account

[Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)

Then ran:

```
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# Then select and copy the contents of the id_ed25519.pub file
  # displayed in the terminal to your clipboard
```

This will output the contents of the id_ed25519.pub file. Copy that. 

---

Now to go GitHub account Settings page 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215186805-87f23636-6787-465a-9fe7-1481bc9f9e01.png)

Click on `SSH and GPG Keys`

Then paste in the output of the 

```
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

command and give it a title too. Once done, click on `Add SSH Key` button at bottom.

### …or create a new repository on the command line

```
echo "# jenkins-devops-microservice" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/NwTestuser/jenkins-devops-microservice.git
git push -u origin main
```

### …or push an existing repository from the command line

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/NwTestuser/jenkins-devops-microservice.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Here, I have the contents of the `jenkins-devops-microservice` folder listed on my Linux machine.  

> The jenkinsfile contains the instructions for your continuous integration build using Jenkins. This should be at the root of your GitHub repository.

Then will run the below commands:

```
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main

We are committing the code into the GitHub repository which we have just created, and if we now do a refresh on the GitHub repository, the GitHub repository is now ready for use.
