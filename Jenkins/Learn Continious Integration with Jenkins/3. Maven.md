Maven is a build tool, so what build mean. Well developers write the code, we call this simply source code.

For example, they are creating a product like a web application, a mobile app. They keep committing the changes to the source code. And while they commit changes, they would like to test it, so they will want to compile the code, especially for the compiled languages like Java, .NET, C, C#. 

So after writing the source code, they will want  to compile it. Once compiled, they want to test the code. If it works as they want it to, they will then package it.  

So the compile process is going to generate some files, the output files, that they package into an archive.

So a source code is generated or changed using programming languages like Java or .Net.

Then the compile process will happen. If the code is Java code, a compiler like JavaC will be used. Once JavaC compiles the source code, it's going to generate the class files.


There'll be unit test or integration tests. These unit tests are tests written by the developers to test their own code. This is not the software testing. So a unit of code will be tested by a unit test. If the code passess this test, the class files will be packaged based on where it is going. For example, if it's a software for a Windows machine, then it will be packaged into an .exe or .msi format.  

jar, war is for Java. So if the product is a Java web application, it will most likely be packaged into a war format.

Developers may also do a health check or code analysis. This process is about finding any upcoming bugs or security vulnerabilities in the code., 

So in short, the above is the entire build process.

however, these are a lot of steps. So developers, along with writing their code, regularly committing their code, and also needing to regularly do this build process, is too much work for them if they have to do it very regularly.

# Build Tools to Automate Build Process

So to automate this build process, there are build tools built to simply automate the build process. Tools such as Mavin, which is for Java. It's based on XML format.

In thr XML file, there are things such as what are the dependencies and what are versioning mechanisms. You then run some maven commands and the maven tool will then execute your build phases, automatically, you don't need to run them manually.

Another tool to build this is ANT but there is more scripting involved in ANT compared to Maven. Another tool to build this is Gradlewhich is in Groovy format.

And there are many other build tools. The oneyou will use is depend on things such as your target programming language.

Because I'm focusing on Java source code, we'll be looking more into Maven in this section. MAVEN is a build tool for Java.
