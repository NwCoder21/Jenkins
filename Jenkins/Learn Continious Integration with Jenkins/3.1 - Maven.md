# Maven - 

# Why do we use Maven?

Maven is a build tool for mostly Java projects. It helps us build the source code by downloading some dependencies. These dependencies are configured by the developers. 

The Maven tool is used to build and manage any kind of a Java based project.

To download the required dependencies, we don't need to go to the official website of each and every software anymore. rather, it can now be done by going to Maven's repository website.

# What is Maven?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/217656285-a4e54012-f22e-41f9-897e-99c4e001872c.png)

The primary goal of the Maven tool is to build, publish, and deploy several projects at once.

Also, apart from being able to build projects written in Java, it can also build projects written in C#, Scala, Ruby. 

Maven helps developers to automate most of the compilation or the build tasks on projects.

# Maven Repository

Maven repository is a location where we can find all the JAR files we need in a single place. So, depending on the software which you want to download, its relative, dependent JAR files can be downloaded from the Maven repository.

There are three type of repositories from where we can download the dependencies:

* Local Repository 
* Remote Repository 
* Central Repository

* The local repository will be primarily present on your local PC.
* The remote repository is something which you can store on any remote machine or remote server.
* The central repository is located on the internet. This means, usually the central repositories is a place where different kind of dependencies and JAR files are hosted.

# Basic Concepts of Maven - POM

POM refers to the XML files that have all the information regarding a project, such as, how this particular project should be build up and  how the different build processes should be automated.

The POM file also has a description of the project details. Versioning information is also stored in the XML file.

# Basic Concepts of Maven - Dependencies and Repositories

For each project, we need to download specific dependencies from particular Maven repositories.

If the dependencies are not present in the local repsoitory, it will then start to look in the remote and central repositories.

# Basic Concepts of Maven - Build Life Cycles, Phases and Goals

When a phase is run, all the goals related to that phase are run. Plugins are compiled to perform compilation, preparing the artifacts, downloading dependencies.

# Basic Concepts of Maven - Build Plugins

Goal of Plugins is to try and automate some of the process such as compilation, creating the VAR file, creating the JAR file.

# Maven Architecture

When Maven is executed, it reads the pom.xml file which contains the build script. Once the pom.xml is read, it will process the dependencies, plugins, life cycles, and build profiles. If need be, it will contact the remote or central repository to download dependencies and plugins if it has not got them already.

So, Maven will read the pom.xml file and then download the dependencies which have been defined in the pom.xml file.
